## Overview

This was one of the more interesting & challenging presentations that I have had to put together. Usually when I create a presentation I have a wealth of knowledge and examples to fall back on. In the case of Vue 3 still being in alpha I didn't have a lot to go on. This took a lot of tinkering around with the source code which I love to do so I was up for the challenge.

I think I watched a few presentations by Evan You at least a dozen times, so Thank You Evan. I also want to give a huge kudos to the entire Vue Core team for the RFCs. These documents were extremely detailed and I loved the fact that they were explicit with the motivation behind each feature. These were the two main resources I used for both learning the new features of Vue 3 and putting together this presentation.

Going into this talk I had higher hopes of showing off more features than I actually covered. I think this is usually the case though whenever I start thinking about a talk and then realizing I only have an hour. I ended up with 134 slides which is extremely ambitious but I will get through them.

After taking a look at all the new features in Vue 3 it became clear to me that there were a couple of goals with this release. First, they wanted to make the framework **Smaller** and **Faster** (which they accomplished) and a lot of what I covered aligned with those goals. Second, they wanted to make the framework scalable and for me that is where the Composition API shines and makes Vue **Stronger**.

This is how I ended up coming up with the title "Vue 3: Smaller, Faster and Stronger" for my presentation. These are a list of features I ended up talking about that really fit into those buckets.

- Smaller
  - TypeScript Rewrite
  - Global API Change
  - Treeshaking
  - Fragments
- Faster
  - Virtual DOM
  - Reactivity System
- Stronger
  - Composition API

Below are some resources such as slides, a Github repository with demo code and any links I mentioned during the presentation.

## Resources

### Slides

For now I have exported my slides to a PDF that you can find in the Github repository below. I might share these out in additional formats later but I am curious to find out how speakers are sharing the keynote presentations so please let me know.

### Github

This repository contains most of the examples that I showed off during my presentation. There was no live coding so most of this code was just shown on slides.

I wrote an article for Vue Mastery on some of my favorite resources for learning Vue 3.
