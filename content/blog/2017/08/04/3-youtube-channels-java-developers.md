I think if I was given the choice to only keep a single website around I would have to go with YouTube. I love it for both entertainment and education and I love creating content on my channel. I am going to share with you 3 YouTube channels I think you should subscribe to. The reason I chose these 3 is that they have all put out some really great content lately. 

## YouTube Channels for Java Developers

### Java

I don't think I could start this list off without including Java. This is a great channel run by Oracle and in the past few days, the released nearly 20 videos.
