In this article, I am going to give you 9 presentations that can you help learn all about Java 9.

## 9 Presentations on Java 9

The following presentations cover a wide variety of topics to help you understand what is coming in Java 9. 

### Real World Java 9 by Trisha Gee

The feature we always hear about whenever Java 9 is in the news is Jigsaw, modularity for Java. But modularity just doesn't scratch the same developer itch that Java 8's lambdas and streams did, and as developers, we're left with a vague sensation that version 9 might just not be that interesting. In fact, Java 9 actually has a lot of great additions and changes which will make Java just that bit nicer to work with. These features can't be lumped under a nice umbrella term like Java 8's lambdas and streams, but the Java 9 changes are scattered throughout the APIs and language features that we regularly use.

### Exploring Java 9 by Venkat Subramaniam

How we write code was greatly influenced by Java 8. How we package the code and interact with it will be impacted by Java 9. In this presentations, we will learn about the major features of Java 9. We will start by discussing the current concerns and how the module system tries to alleviate those pains. We will learn about modules, how to define dependencies, and also how to work with existing jar files. Finally, we will explore Java 9 REPL, the reasons to use it, and various features that can benefit the programmers. Dr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., creator of agilelearner.com, and an instructional professor at the University of Houston. He has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences. Venkat helps his clients effectively apply and succeed with sustainable agile practices on their software projects. Venkat is a (co)author of multiple technical books, including the 2007 Jolt Productivity award-winning book Practices of an Agile Developer. You can find a list of his books at agiledeveloper.com. You can reach him by email at venkats@agiledeveloper.com or on Twitter at @venkat\_s

### 55 New Features in JDK 9 by Simon Ritter

Following on from the popular “55 New Features in Java SE 8” we bring you the eagerly-awaited sequel, “55 New Features in JDK 9”. Obviously, the big new feature in JDK 9 is modularity and project Jigsaw, but there’s lots more to tempt developers. We’ll divide things into five categories:

* Features
* Standards
* Inside the JVM
* Specialised
* Housekeeping

Join us on a whirlwind tour of what’s in (and what’s out) in JDK 9 so you’re ready to get started with the latest version of the most popular programming platform on the planet.

### What You Need to Know About Java 9, Including Migration by Simon Maple

Java 9 is due for release in just a few months. The latest version brings new, interesting features including modules, JShell, G1GC, and many improvements to the existing programming model. This session examines what these features mean to developer and production environments and delves into what you need to know when migrating to the latest version. What do you need to do to make your applications modular? How do you break down your existing application to make them run in the module-path? How does the new default garbage collector affect how your application will run in production? Come to this session to learn what's new in Java 9 and discover how to best adopt and migrate to the new version.

### Migrating to Java 9 Modules by Paul Bakker

Java 9 comes to your doorstep with major changes to all of us, whether you ordered it or not. The module system in Java 9 is a great advancement for the Java language, and we would like to migrate existing code to make use of the module system. Migrating an existing code base from the classpath to any kind of module system can be a daunting task, however. Not only do we have to take care of migrating our own code to modules, we also have to take third party libraries into consideration. Java 9 comes with a number of features to ease migration. This includes automatic modules, the unnamed module and a number of command line arguments. While these features provide great value, they do require a deep understanding of the module system to use them to their full potential. In this talk, we will look at examples of migrating real code, based on a Spring/Hibernate application. We will face common problems we run into during migration, which gives us practical tips to apply, but also a good understanding of the module framework itself and the various migration features it supports. This talk is an excellent preparation to start migrating your own code. Paul Bakker is a senior software engineer with Netflix in the Edge Developer Experience team. Besides loving to write code he has a passion for sharing knowledge. He is the co-author of "Java 9 Modularity" that will be published by O'Reilly in 2017, and the co-author of "Modular Cloud Apps with OSGi" which was published by O'Reilly in 2013. Paul is also frequently speaking at conferences about Modularity, container technology, and many other topics.

### Modular Development with JDK 9 by Alex Buckley

A modular development style benefits every Java developer, whether your application is one JAR or one hundred JARs. This session will introduce the Java 9 module system that's been used to structure the JDK as dozens of reusable modules that strongly protect their internals. Then, the session will explain how you can create modules to enforce the structure inherent in your application. The session will prepare you for some of the pitfalls of modular development, notably the technical debt present in popular libraries that rely on JDK internals. Finally, the session will look at how tools are preparing for modules. Alex Buckley is the Specification Lead for the Java programming language and the Java Virtual Machine at Oracle. He holds a Ph.D. in Computing from Imperial College London.

### JDK 9 Language, Tooling, and Library Features by Joe Darcy

Modularity support from Project Jigsaw is the largest change coming in Java SE 9, but many other improvements are coming to the Java programming language, related tooling, and libraries in JDK 9. On the language front, some polish is added to the Project Coin features and the number of uninformative warnings has been reduced. The javac tool can now accurately cross-compile to older platform versions and has improved attribution engineering to better support type inference. Javadoc is getting a search box, a new modernized doclet API, and HTML5 support. The libraries offer better process control, improved collections, and more-compact strings. Learn more at this session. Joe Darcy is a long-time JDK engineer who has worked on projects ranging over floating-point arithmetic, introducing annotation processing to javac, serving as the inaugural release manager for OpenJDK 6, leading the Project Coin language additions, and migrating JDK bugs to a JIRA system.

### Enhanced Deprecation in Java 9 by Stuart Marks

Java has grown immensely since its introduction, more than 20 years ago. However, there has not been a corresponding effort to remove obsolete features from the system. Some features have been deprecated, but very few have actually been removed. The platform has grown ever larger and more complex, resulting in an accumulation of complexity and technical debt. These impose a continual tax on development. This session explores “depreciation,” the trailing edge of the feature lifecycle. This includes work in Java 9 to update and clarify the @Deprecated annotation, plus additional tools being provided to enable developers to assess the impact of depreciation on their codebases and to help them deal with code migration more effectively.

### Interactive Development and Fast Feedback with Java 9 REPL by Venkat Subramaniam

Programming is an act of continuous discoveries. Auto-Completion in IDEs are great, but they're more of a speculation than experimentation. Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop or REPL gives an instant feedback and the ability to quickly try out your ideas. Fast feedbacks are the rage today in development. Come to this all live coding, no slides session to learn how to leverage the Java 9 REPL to accelerate your Java Development.
