Spring Boot includes a number of additional features to help you monitor and manage your application when it’s pushed to production. You can choose to manage and monitor your application using HTTP endpoints, with JMX or even by a remote shell (SSH or Telnet). Auditing, health and metrics gathering can be automatically applied to your application. In this article, we will take a look at how to include the actuator in your next project and what endpoints are available. 

## Actuator Dependencies

If you look all the way down the list you find the ops category and this is where our Spring Boot Actuator & Actuator Docs dependencies live.

If you want to add the actuator and actuator docs to an existing project simply include the following dependencies. 

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-actuator-docs</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

_\* Actuator HTTP endpoints are only available with a Spring MVC-based application._

## Spring Boot Actuator Endpoints

Actuator endpoints allow you to monitor and interact with your application. Spring Boot includes a number of built-in endpoints and you can also add your own. This means that if you run the application and go to http://localhost:8080/health you will get the health endpoint.  Please create a simple application on your own and trying visiting some of the endpoints.

If you are using Spring MVC, the following additional endpoints can also be used:

| ID         |                                                                                            Description                                                                                            | Sensitive Default |
| ---------- | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | ----------------: |
| `docs`     |                  Displays documentation, including example requests and responses, for the Actuator’s endpoints. Requires  `spring-boot-actuator-docs`  to be on the classpath.                   |             false |
| `heapdump` |                                                                        Returns a GZip compressed  `hprof`  heap dump file.                                                                        |              true |
| `jolokia`  |                                                                  Exposes JMX beans over HTTP (when Jolokia is on the classpath).                                                                  |              true |
| `logfile`  | Returns the contents of the logfile (if  `logging.file`  or  `logging.path`  properties have been set). Supports the use of the HTTP  `Range`  header to retrieve part of the log file’s content. |              true |



## Actuator Security

If you tried to visit some of the endpoints you might have received an error that looks like this. 

![Actuator Security](./2017-05-11_18-16-40.png)

This is because by default the /beans endpoint is secured. It might have sensitive information and we wouldn't want this information available to just anyone in production. If you look at the list of endpoints above you can see which ones are secured by default.  If you want to disable the security of these endpoints in development you can do so by adding the following to your application.properties file.

```bash
management.security.enabled=false
```
