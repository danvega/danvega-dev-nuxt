This is the third and final article in the series I did for Vue Mastery. You can read all three of these articles over on Vue Mastery:

- [Unit Testing in Vue: What to test](https://www.vuemastery.com/blog/unit-testing-vue-1)
- [Unit Testing in Vue: Writing your first Test](https://www.vuemastery.com/blog/Unit-Testing-in-Vue-Your-First-Test)
- [Unit Testing in Vue: Testing More Complex Components](https://www.vuemastery.com/blog/Unit-Testing-in%20Vue-More-complex-components)

In part one of the series we really focused on identifying what to test and more importantly what NOT to test in your components. From there we wrote our first test in part two and spent some time understanding the different libraries involved. In part three we learn through repetition by writing more unit tests with a couple of components that add some new wrinkles.

I want to thank Adam and Gregg over at Vue Mastery for giving me this opportunity to write for them. I have always looked up to them for their unique style of teaching and everything they do for the Vue community. I don't think this is the last time you will see me collaborating with them and I am looking forward to what we do next.

I put a lot of hard work into this series and if you enjoyed it please let them know. I hope you're having a wonderful day and as always friends....

Happy Coding<br/>
