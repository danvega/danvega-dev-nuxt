If you're [subscribed to my newsletter](https://www.danvega.dev/signup/) than you know I have been working on a series of articles for my friends over at Vue Mastery for a little while now. The series is titled "A beginner's guide: Unit Testing in Vue" and has been broken into 3 parts. I am really excited to announce that the first article in this series is now live.

In this first post we take a look at why you should test, what you should test and more importantly what not to test. In this article you will learn:

- Why are we writing tests to begin with? What are the goals of testing?
- How to Identify what you should (and should NOT) be testing
- What are the different tools used to write these tests
