Agentic coding assistants and editor-based AI chat interfaces are altering the development workflow leading some to proclaim the end of software engineering. Is it time to explore other careers? Not so fast, the rumors of our demise are greatly exaggerated! While these tools can boost productivity, to be used effectively, developers still need to master the fundamentals of the software craft.

Modern software development demands more than just coding proficiency—it requires navigating an increasingly AI-augmented landscape. In this workshop, we'll work through hands-on exercises that demonstrate why fundamental skills like system design, debugging, testing, and code review are more important than ever.

## What You'll Learn

- Why AI tools amplify rather than replace fundamental engineering skills
- Hands-on exercises with AI-assisted development workflows
- How to evaluate and validate AI-generated code effectively
- System design principles that AI can't replace
- Testing strategies for AI-augmented development
- Best practices for integrating AI tools into your daily workflow
