description: "Learn how to securely and efficiently connect AI models with enterprise data and tools using the Model Context Protocol in Java."
---

As Large Language Models (LLMs) revolutionize application development, Java developers face a critical challenge: how to securely and efficiently connect these AI models with enterprise data and tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is transforming how AI applications interact with external systems, and it's rapidly becoming an industry standard.

In this session, you'll learn the basic building blocks of MCP and how to build, secure, and test your MCP servers. We'll explore practical examples that demonstrate how to bridge the gap between LLMs and your existing Java infrastructure.

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding the Model Context Protocol and its architecture
- Building MCP servers in Java from scratch
- Securing MCP servers for enterprise environments
- Testing strategies for MCP server implementations
- Connecting LLMs to enterprise data sources via MCP
- Real-world patterns for production MCP deployments
