description: "Exploring the essential software engineering skills that remain critical as AI transforms the development workflow."
---

Agentic coding assistants and editor-based AI chat interfaces are altering the development workflow leading some to proclaim the end of software engineering. Is it time to explore other careers? Not so fast, the rumors of our demise are greatly exaggerated! While these tools can boost productivity, to be used effectively, developers still need to master the fundamentals of the software craft.

Modern software development demands more than just coding proficiency—it requires navigating an increasingly AI-augmented landscape. In this session, we'll explore what it truly means to be a software engineer today and why the fundamentals matter more than ever.

## What You'll Learn

- Why AI tools amplify rather than replace fundamental engineering skills
- The core competencies every developer still needs to master
- How to evaluate and validate AI-generated code effectively
- System design principles that AI can't replace
- Practical strategies for staying relevant in an AI-augmented world
- Real-world examples of where AI helps and where it falls short
