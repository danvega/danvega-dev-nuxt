description: "Learn how to bring generative AI to Java applications through practical examples with Spring AI."
---

As AI becomes essential for enterprise apps, Java developers need to add intelligent features without rewriting their stack. This introduction to Spring AI shows how to bring generative AI to Java applications through practical examples.

Learn to build chatbots, implement RAG for enhanced context, and use MCP for AI orchestration. Write model-agnostic code that works with cloud and local LLMs. See how Spring AI's familiar abstractions make adding intelligent features feel natural for Java developers.

## What You'll Learn

- Getting started with Spring AI and its core abstractions
- Building chatbots with conversational memory
- Implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced context
- Using Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI orchestration
- Writing model-agnostic code that works with multiple LLM providers
- Practical examples you can apply to your own projects
