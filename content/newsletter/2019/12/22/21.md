Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, Dan Vega. This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you missed last week's newsletter you can checkout Coffee and Code #20 [here](https://www.danvega.dev/newsletter/coffee-and-code/20). If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it.

## Previous Week

Last week was the first time I missed a newsletter and I would like to apologize for that. This past weekend was the culmination of months of planning for me and my team. I run an event called Toys for Shots here in Cleveland and Saturday night was our 12th time doing so. If you're interested in learning more you can visit [www.toysforshots.com](http://www.toysforshots.com) or [check out some pictures](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPKY5YQ-Jh8C4XJJZZ8BEnQKkdLryxWhlx98evSPJ3u-TVFFjxoJDkUdJ_-Fdo1Dg?key=RVZWc1BMYjRQcVBwUldrWjh5UWJIcDRQS2lGN3NR) from the event.

### New Course: Blog Post

I already sent out an email about this but I wrote up my motivation behind creating my new course. If you end up taking the course I would really love your feedback.

### State of JavaScript 2109

The state of JavaScript survey was sent out earlier this year and the results are in. What I really love about this survey is the amazing job they do to present the data. Data on its own isn't all that exciting but the results are both fun to read through and look at. Did any of the results stand out for you?
