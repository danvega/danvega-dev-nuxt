## Previous Week

It was Thanksgiving this week here in the US and I just want to start this issue off by saying thank you to all of you. I appreciate that you are all here on my mailing list and that you give me a chance to ramble once a week. With that said, let's get into this week (shorter than normal) issue.

### New Course: Up and Running with Vue.js

If you have been paying attention to this blog at all you know that I am a huge fan of Vue. One of my favorite features of Vue is just how approachable it is for beginners. I was looking around at the landscape of Vue courses in the marketplace and I had a few thoughts.

First, there are some really great courses from some awesome authors out there. Second, a lot of the introductions to Vue come with hours of additional content which can seem overwhelming to beginners.

With that, I set out to build a course for absolute beginners. I had a couple of goals that I wanted to stick to when I began building out this course. The first was I wanted to keep this course short and the finished version comes in under 2 hours. Next, I wanted to make sure that reinforce concepts that you were learning along the way with quizzes, exercises, and coding challenges. Finally, I wanted to target developers who just wanted to drop a script tag on a page and go. This means that that you don't need to understand Node & NPM and there are no command-line interfaces (CLI) to install.

I am really happy with the result and I will have more to share with you in the near future but I wanted to share it with you. If you use the link below you can grab the course for \$9.99. If you know someone who might be interested in the course please pass the link along and I appreciate you supporting me friends.
