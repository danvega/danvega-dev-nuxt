Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, Dan Vega. This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you missed last week's newsletter you can checkout Coffee and Code #19 [here](https://www.danvega.dev/newsletter/coffee-and-code/19). If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it.

## Previous Week

This week I worked on my new course, a blog post and a video for YouTube. If someone would have invited me on a podcast I would have completed the content dream ðŸ¤£I have a lot to talk about this week so let's get right into it.

### Up & Running with Vue Trailer

This week I was able to record, edit and publish a trailer for my new course. This course is an introduction to Vue for beginners. Previously I just had the first video as the trailer and that is never a good idea. I wanted a short trailer letting potential students know what they can expect from the course and what my motivation behind creating it was. I haven't really promoted this course much because I wanted to have this in place first.

You can check out the trailer on the course landing page using the link below. For anyone who has already purchased the course or purchases it in the future, I appreciate the support!

### Top ways to learn Vue 3

I wrote a blog post for Vue Mastery and it was published on Monday. In this blog post I walk you through some of my favorite resources for learning Vue 3. This was especially helpful for me as I am preparing for a Vue 3 talk at [CodeMash](https://www.codemash.org/) in January.

### Creating a bare Vue project using the Vue CLI

When I watch others create new Vue projects using the Vue CLI I often see the same steps. They will create the project, and then remove all of the boilerplate code that the CLI gives you. They start with removing the `HelloWorld.vue` component and the code needed to import it and display it in `App.vue`. Whenever I tell them that there is an option you can pass to the `vue create` command to remove that boilerplate code they are amazed. This video is a short one but definitely helpful, hope you enjoy it.

### Closing in on 100,000 monthly page views!

I started this year off by creating the website [https://www.danvega.dev](https://www.danvega.dev). I wanted to get my blog off of WordPress and on to a static site and Vue + Gridsome seemed to be a great fit for what I wanted to do. I started off with 0 blog posts and just started writing about whatever inspired me that day. I really enjoyed the workflow of writing in markdown, committing to Git and the article being live on my site.

I decided pretty early on that I was going to move my existing posts over but I needed to figure out how to do it. I have been blogging for 15 years and had accumulated nearly 1000 posts. I knew that a lot of them were no longer relevant or didn't contain much value. I want all of the articles on my blog to be helpful and not some review of some movie I watched last weekend. It is the end of the year I am happy to say that all of the posts I wanted to move are now moved over.

About a month ago I got rid of Google Analytics and forked over the \$9 a month to Netlify for their analytics and I did this for a couple of reasons. Netlify is just such a fantastic service that I wanted to give them money for something, no I'm not kidding about that. Second, Google Analytics can be blocked and by my tech-savvy audience, it is probably being blocked more times than not. Because of this, I don't think I have ever got a real good gauge on where I was stats wise.

I have been paying attention to my stats lately and they have been on the rise. I logged in this week and to my surprise I had 92,463 page views in the last month. I can't believe that I am closing in on 100,000 and I am going to make the push to get there.

I attribute these stats to a couple of things. The first is I cut out a lot of content that wasn't really valuable to anyone. I learned this from an episode of the Smart Passive Income with Pat Flynn titled [How Deleting a Third of Your Content Can Triple Your Trafficâ€”How to Do a Content Audit with Todd Tresidder](https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/podcasts/how-to-do-a-content-audit-with-todd-tresidder/). After that, it was all about providing good content to my readers along with a new super-fast static website. I'm excited about the future of this blog and thank all of you who support it.
