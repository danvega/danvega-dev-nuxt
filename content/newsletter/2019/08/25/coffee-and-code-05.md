Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, Dan Vega. This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it.

## Previous Week

It was my birthday this week (I lost count at this point) and I want to thank everyone who reached out to me to wish me a Happy Birthday.

### Vue Composition API

Back in June VueJS released an RFC (request for comments) called **_Function-based Component API_**. There were some that got really upset with this proposal and it caused a lot of conversation in the community. This week the Vue Core Team released an updated version of the RFC titled [**_Composition API_**](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/78).

I think a lot of the complaints came from everyone thinking that this is how they would have to write their Single File Components (SFC) and that just wasn't the case. There are some important changes to the RFC and if you want to learn more about the Composition API there is an entire documentation site dedicated to it.

### **Blog**

I don't have any new articles this week but I do have one that a bunch of folks have been sharing on Twitter lately. If you are in the JavaScript ecosystem you know there is this package manager called NPM.

Most of us just use it as away to pull dependencies into our projects but have you ever thought about creating your NPM package? if so I have this really great article that walks you through creating and publishing your [first NPM package](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2019/02/10/creating-your-first-npm-package).

### Follow This Person

I came across a presentation by Raju Gandhi on testing for some research I am doing on the topic and I was just blown away. When I come across people like this I try to find as much content from them as possible. I also listened to a [podcast](https://nofluffjuststuff.com/podcast/1/raju_gandhi_on_vuejs_and_evaluating_web_frameworks) that he was on talking about how much he enjoys working with VueJS.

Raju has a Java background, loves Vue and dabbles in all kinds of tech. Did I mention he also lives in Ohio? I need to tak some time, head down to Columbus and hang out with Raju soon! Please give him a follow on Twitter using the link below.
