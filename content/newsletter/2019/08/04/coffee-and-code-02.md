Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, [Dan Vega](https://www.danvega.dev/). This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it.

## Previous Week

I was really busy this week but I was able to sneak in a live coding session yesterday so we can talk about that. I also started playing around with [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) this week. If you're a Java developer have you had a chance to check it out yet? So far I am really enjoying just how fast and easy to use it is. If you have used it before or you're interested in seeing some content from me on it please let me know.

### **Live Stream**

I was able to sneak a live stream in yesterday and it was a lot of fun. I was going to try streaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/danvega) but I had some problems so I ended up just going live on YouTube. I am still learning the platforms and figuring out how to use them so I apologize for any issues.

In this coding session, I wanted to start building out a newsletter archive. I want you to have the ability to read a newsletter item online and share it with friends. If you are reading this in an email client you can look towards the top where there is a `Read this on danvega.dev` link.

We spent some time talking about how to add a new file system source and a new content type. If you're interested in watching the replay it has been posted on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/5lXmyp4DJxg).

### **Blog**

I don't have anything new this week but I will share with you an article that I mentioned in the live stream. Each of my blog posts has a lot of metadata at the top of the markdown file. I don't like having to look these up and write them by hand so I wrote a [generator for creating blog posts in Gridsome](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2019/04/23/gridsome-blog-post-generator/).

### YouTube

[How to Remove Elements from an ArrayList in Java.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_3rrcZVgg&feature=youtu.be)

In this tutorial, we are going to learn how to safely remove elements from an ArrayList in Java while using a for loop to loop over that same list.

## Upcoming Week

I can't believe it but we have another cohort graduating from Tech Elevator in 2 weeks. I am a product manager for a team of students building their final capstone project so between that and my own project work is going to take up most of my time.

I need to find a way to schedule out these live coding sessions. Would it be helpful if they were at the same time every week? Reach out to me and let me know.
