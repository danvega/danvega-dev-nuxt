Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, Dan Vega. This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it.

## Previous Week

I try and keep all things negative off of social media because there is enough of it on there. With that said I have posted some tweets of late that weren't all that positive that had to do with burnout and I just want to thank all of you who reached out. I appreciate all of you so, so much.

I have some exciting news to share with you about Tech Elevator but a little news about what I was up to this week. I was able to finish the rough draft of that huge article I was working on for the Vue community. It has gone through the editing process and now I just need to make some corrections and it should be ready to be published soon so stay on the lookout for that.

I did some testing in my office this week with video sets, green screens and I even ran a quick test on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/danvega). I think I have a pretty solid setup and I might even try another Twitch stream after this newsletter goes out so if you haven't done so already [please follow me](https://www.twitch.tv/danvega).

### Tech Elevator

Next week we welcome over 200 students across 5 locations in 3 states as new cohorts begin. I just want to wish all of our students good luck. It is not easy but if you work hard you will get through it. Now, on to some really exciting news!

This was a huge week at [Tech Elevator](https://www.techelevator.com/) where we announced our 6th location would be opening up in Philadelphia. If you want to read more about why we are so excited about this opportunity I would encourage you to [read this article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/liberating-potential-birthplace-america-anthony-hughes/) by our CEO, Anthony Hughes. As exciting as expansion is, growth without a mission isn't sustainable.

You will find a lot of coding bootcamps boasting about their numbers without any verified data to back them up. Here at Tech Elevator, we submit all of our results to [CIRR](https://cirr.org/), The Council on Integrity in Results Reporting. CIRR is an independent, non-profit organization whose members believe that prospective students should know a school's outcomes before deciding whether to enroll.

CIRR posted our result this week and Tech Elevator is graduating 95% of students across all our campuses and of that 94% are getting placed within 180 days of graduating. The starting salary of students entering our program is $30,000 and the average starting salary when they leave is $58,000. This means that in just 14 weeks students are leaving with double their salary and a career that they are excited about.

This allows all of you to see what I already know, Tech Elevator is all about changing our student's lives. This makes me so happy because not only are we growing but we are doing it the right way and this is something I am incredibly proud of.

So enough bragging, what does this mean for you? First, we are hiring across many of our [locations for multiple positions](https://www.techelevator.com/join-our-team). If you enjoy mentoring and have a real passion for software development you might be a great fit as an instructor. If you would like to hear more about becoming an instructor or have any questions please feel free to contact me.

This also means that if you have any friends or family in the Philadelphia area that are interested in a career in software development you need to tell them about Tech Elevator. Our results speak for themselves, we give you everything you need to start a new career in software development. I truly believe in what we do here and again if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.

I have known [Todd](https://twitter.com/recursivecodes) for a long time and he is just one of those great people you come across in life. In a former life, we were both ColdFusion developers living around Cleveland until he decided to move out to Georgia. Todd is now a developer advocate for Oracle and he builds some pretty cool things. On top of that, he's a great family man and I am lucky to call him a friend.
