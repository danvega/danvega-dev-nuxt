Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, Dan Vega. This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you missed last week's newsletter you can checkout Coffee and Code #16 [here](https://www.danvega.dev/newsletter/coffee-and-code/16). If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it.

## Previous Week

I had a pretty busy week that includes some website updates, a new video on YouTube

## Website Updates

I pushed a few updates to my website this week and I think they are for the better. The first thing you might [notice](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2019/04/30/up-and-running-with-vue/) is the font family has changed to `Roboto Slab` and it is much larger, 22px to be specific.

I also updated the footer for each blog post. I had this large obnoxious newsletter signup form and I just wasn't happy with it. I still have the newsletter signup but its not as obtrusive now and I have added comments to blog posts. I have been holding off on adding comments but after giving it some thought I really wanted to add them in. I decided to go with [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) which I was using for my old blog but this time I decided to pay for and remove those annoying ads.

## Hello, Vue 3

I¬†have begun preparing for a talk I¬†am giving at CodeMash 2020 "Vue 3:¬†Smaller, Faster, Stronger". If you're going to be at CodeMash please make sure you say hi üëãüèª. I¬†also may or may not be turning this into a course in the new year so If that is of any interest to you let me know.

Vue 3.0 won't be out until the end of Q1 2020 but that doesn't mean you can't start playing with it right now. I¬†created a new [tutorial for my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAgO2JanN9Y) that shows you how to get started with Vue 3 today.

In this tutorial, you will create a simple example in Vue 2 by just dropping a script tag on a page. Next, we will download the Vue 3 source code (currently pre-alpha) from Github, build it and drop it on a page and recreate that example using the composition API.
