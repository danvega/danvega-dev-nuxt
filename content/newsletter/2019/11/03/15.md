Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, Dan Vega. This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you missed last week's newsletter you can checkout Coffee and Code #14 [here](https://www.danvega.dev/newsletter/coffee-and-code/14). If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it.

## Previous Week

This week I posted a new video on YouTube and the third and final part of my series on Unit testing in Vue was released.

## Vue for beginners Tutorial

This week I posted a new video on YouTube [Vue for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGgXAHbQHeI). I know that getting started with a new framework can be pretty intimidating and even more so in the JavaScript ecosystem. The point of this video was to demonstrate just how versatile Vue is and how I think it's perfect for beginners.

When you visit [https://vuejs.org](https://vuejs.org/) the first thing you will see is that Vue is known as **_The Progressive JavaScript Framework_**. At first, this might seem like some marketing jargon but it's not and for me, it's part of the story that makes Vue so welcoming.

This just means that you can incrementally adopt Vue as your needs start to grow. You can start using Vue right now by dropping a script tag on a page and you are ready to go. No need to buy into build processes, code splitting or module bundlers.

This video walks you through how to use Vue on a new page or in an existing application by just including a script tag. This type of content is what I have been working on for my new course "Up and Running with VueJS". [Sign up the course landing page](https://danvega.ck.page/823d5f3bee) and you will get the first 5 lessons of this course for free! More information on this new course coming soon.

## Unit Testing in Vue

The third and final article in the the [series I did for Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/blog/Unit-Testing-in%20Vue-More-complex-components) has been released. In part three we learn more about writing Unit tests in Vue by looking at a few more complex examples. I really enjoyed putting this series together and I hope you learned something from it.
