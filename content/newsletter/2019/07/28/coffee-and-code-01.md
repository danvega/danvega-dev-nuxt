Welcome to the first installment of Coffee and Code with me, [Dan Vega](https://www.danvega.dev/). It's a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. I will try and keep these pretty short and digestible. So if you don't have a cup of coffee go and grab one and if you do, let's get to it.

## Previous Week

### **Live Stream**

This week I ran my very first live stream and while I was a little bit nervous I was really happy with the way everything turned out. I have been saying for a while now that I wanted to start live streaming and I finally stopped coming up with excuses and jumped right in. I want to thank all of you who took time out of your day to join me. It is much easier to do these live sessions with an interactive audience.

In this live stream, I started by giving the current state of web application architecture types. Then we dove into what static site generators are and spent a little bit of time on what the "JAM Stack" is.

Finally, we wrapped up by looking at a VueJS static site generator called Gridsome. This is the framework I used to build my new site and I have been impressed with it. I walked you through setting up your first Gridsome site and I showed you the start of how you could build your own blog.

If you weren't able to make the live stream the [recording is posted on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEBTiMpvgas).

### **Blog**

This week I also [wrote an article](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2019/07/23/website-new-features-improvements) on new features and improvements to my website. These were a series of new features that I have been working on and I was excited to get these out there.

## Upcoming Week

I am still working on a schedule for live streaming but here are a few topics I have in mind.

- Adding a Newsletter archive to my website
- Building a Gridsome Starter with my blog theme
- Vuex Intro
- Vue Function Based Component API

If you have an idea for something you would like to see me cover in a live stream please feel free to reach out to me.
