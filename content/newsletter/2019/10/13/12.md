Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, Dan Vega. This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you missed last week's newsletter you can checkout Coffee and Code #11 [here](https://www.danvega.dev/newsletter/2019/10/06/coffee-and-code-11/). If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it.

## Previous Week

I don't have anything in the form of new content but I did spend some time cleaning up my office this weekend. I had a lot of people asking me about my gear so I thought I would share it with you. This is an image of my office and I will walk through some of my gear below.

I have been searching for a good mount to go behind my monitor that I could put my DSLR on and I finally found one. [Elgato came out with a Multi-Mount](https://amzn.to/2M8CfVU) which clamps right on my desk and at the minimum height still fits over my widescreen monitor. It also extends higher so If I want to stand up and do some talking head videos I can. I also have the [green screen from Elgato](https://amzn.to/35tGVx0) and I just love everything they release!
