Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, Dan Vega. This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it.

## Previous Week

I created two new videos this week for YouTube and I had a lot of fun putting them together. I still don't know what I am doing on YouTube but what I realized is I am not going to figure it out by sitting around and doing nothing. This is why I have been mixing up with tutorials and discussions and I would love to hear your feedback.

### Vue 3

Probably the best news of the week was when Even You dropped the bomb at Vue London dropped Vue 3 alpha. If you haven't had a chance you can download Vue 3 and start hacking away right now!
