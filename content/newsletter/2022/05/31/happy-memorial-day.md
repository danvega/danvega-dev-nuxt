Good morning friends. I hope everyone in the US had a happy Memorial day weekend. I want to thank every one of you who has served or is currently serving. Your dedication and bravery to this country are inspiring and we are lucky to have you protecting us.

I only have a couple of things to share with you this week but the next edition of the newsletter should be a little bit more exciting.

I am hitting the road next week for [SpringOne Tour Toronto](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/springone-tour/2022/toronto/) and [VueConf US](https://us.vuejs.org/). If you‚Äôre at either of those conferences please come say hi. If you want to see a list of events that I will be at this year you can check out the speaking page on my website.

## Spring for GraphQL

Spring for GraphQL 1.0 has been released! This is a huge milestone and the culmination of a really great collaboration between the Spring team and the¬†GraphQL Java team. I put together an article on the release and a video tutorial walking you through the basics of how to get started with Spring for GraphQL.

## Spring Office Hours

DaShaun and I have been busy with our new live stream called Spring Office Hours. This is a chance to tell you what‚Äôs new in the Spring Community, show off something we are working on, and answer your questions. I think we have gotten into a good grove and I am excited about the future of this show. If you want you can check out some of our recent episodes below.
