Welcome back to another edition of the newsletter. This week I have a lot of new content to share with you, I‚Äôm working on a new Spring Boot Tutorial for YouTube and Adobe buys Figma.

## Current Status

Last week was a busy week and this week isn‚Äôt slowing down. I have a presentation coming up on Thursday with my coworker and friend Nate Schutta. We are going to present on Spring Recipes where we show a problem and then how you can go about solving it in Spring. If you‚Äôre interested in attending you can [register for free here](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/webinars/sep-22-spring-recipes-a-collection-of-common-sense-solutions).

I‚Äôm currently facing an issue with my Sony 6100 and overheating during my live streams. I think this issue has to do with me messing with my settings and turning the quality up to 4k for my local recordings. After doing some research I found out that this could be causing my issues. I am going to try and run a test this week before my presentation to see if I can correct this. I am curious to hear from my audience though, has anyone else run into this issue?

Finally, I have to start my week off with the embarrassing end to the Browns game yesterday. They were up 13 points with less than 2 minutes to go and found a way to lose that game. It is really hard to be a Browns fan and this quote from the late great Les Levine sums it up:

## Content Creation

I recently reorganized my office to be more functional when it comes to creating content and it‚Äôs starting to pay off. While I was able to create some pretty solid content this week I know there is plenty of room for improvement and I am looking forward to learning and getting better. If you‚Äôre interested in what I have been doing to my office let me know and I will share it one week in this newsletter.

### Spring Office Hours

DaShaun and I got back to streaming and had a successful [Spring Office Hours](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/tv/spring-office-hours/). What I love most about these shows is we get to hear from you and find out what problems you‚Äôre facing. We took a lot of notes from this show and have some plans to address some of the questions in the near future. The big thing we want to do with this show is getting more consistent and we have scheduled the next 3 shows. For now, we will go live on Tuesday afternoons at 3:30 EDT. Here is the replay of Episode 11:

### YouTube

As I write this, I just realized that I posted 6 new videos to YouTube this week. While 3 of them were YouTube Shorts this type of productivity is just not sustainable but regardless it was a fun week.

In this tutorial, I answered a question I got from a subscriber. He needed to be able to consume a third-party API, save that information to a database and then send it to another service. I recreated this flow into a fun little tutorial that I hope answered the question.

I have been publishing a lot of tutorials related to Spring Security lately. In almost all of those demos, I use an in-memory user because it‚Äôs quick and I am trying to keep these tutorials on the topic. While this is great for demos it isn‚Äôt going to be used in the real world. In this tutorial, I discuss how to authenticate against a database using the `JdbcUserDetailsManager`.

### YouTube Shorts

I consume content from a lot of the big YouTubers out there and all of them are telling me that I don‚Äôt want to miss the short-form content train. Knowing that I decided to get on board and at least see what kind of content I can produce and if it helps out at all.

After a few videos, the one thing I really enjoy is that it has to be less than 60 seconds which means I can shoot, edit and publish videos much faster. The more videos I work on the more editing experience I gain. The challenge I am finding right now is that it‚Äôs really hard to record my screen in 9:16 format but I managed to get a tutorial in this week and it turned out ok.

### Spring Boot Tutorial

I created a post on YouTube asking my subscribers so I thought I would also pose this question to you. I am working on an outline for a big tutorial that I would like to release on YouTube. This is probably going to be a pretty long video but I want to target developers new to Spring. The idea is here are all the basics you need to know to create and deploy your first application. This is a rough outline of what I have so far:

- Why Spring?
- Spring Framework vs Spring Boot
- What is Spring used for?
- Create a new project
- Spring Framework Core
    - Application Context
    - Beans
    - IoC / Dependency Injection
- Logging
- Externalized Configuration
- CRUD RestController
- Connect to a database
    - H2
    - PostgreSQL (Docker Compose)
- Testing
- Deployment

## Adobe Acquires Figma

The big news that dropped last week was that [Adobe was purchasing Figma](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2022/Adobe-to-Acquire-Figma/default.aspx). I heard a lot of fans of Figma up in arms that the big bad evil empire of Adobe purchased their favorite tool and they were going to run it into the ground. First off, I don‚Äôt think they paid 20 billion dollars to run it into the ground. Second, I saw the following excerpt in an email from Adobe:

<blockquote>While we have been reducing our investment in XD, we will continue to support it. We are excited about Figma's vision for the future of product design and the potential of our teams coming together to benefit our customers.</blockquote>

The reason I bring this up today is because I am a huge fan of Adobe XD. I use it to create all of my YouTube thumbnails, images for my website and any promo graphics for courses or social media. I started using it because it was included in my Adobe subscription and then grew to love it. I‚Äôm sad that it might be going away but I‚Äôm also excited that a popular tool like Figma might be part of my subscription going forward.

I happen to have a lot of love for Adobe and the people that work there. I wish them nothing but continued success and congratulate them and the Figma team on this acquisition.

## SpringOne 2022

Our long-running¬†[SpringOne conference](https://springone.io/) is coming up December 6th to 8th, in San Francisco. There will be an amazing lineup of speakers and sessions and we are back in person. I will be giving a workshop on getting started with Spring Boot and hopefully a general session. You can get $200 off when registering if you use the code S1VM22_Advocate_200.
