I hope you all had a great weekend and are ready to go on this Monday morning. In this edition of the newsletter, I want to talk about my first week at VMware,  a demo I put together of a Nuxt 3 application talking to the Notion API, The Kubernetes documentary, The JChampions conference, and some Spring Goodies from last week.

## My first week at VMware

If you missed last week's newsletter you missed a pretty big announcement. I joined VMware as a Spring Developer advocate and wrote all about it [here](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2022/01/24/im-joining-v-mware/). I put together a [video version](https://youtu.be/TYXdX-EakG8) of that blog post to share with my YouTube audience and it gave me a chance to expand on some of my thoughts.

My first week went about as well as I could have hoped. For as large a company as VMware is our onboarding process is really great. I was able to learn more about the company and our processes as well as get my laptop set up with everything I need to get going. The benefits are amazing and a reminder to everyone that you should always take a look at what benefits a company is offering as part of your overall compensation package. The salary is great the place to start but it isnâ€™t everything.

I have also started building out my schedule for the year. I donâ€™t know what I can say publicly yet but like everyone else, we are hoping we can return to some in-person events this year. I started working on what events I would be at as well as submitting to a number of conferences.

I got invited to do a live stream on the [IntelliJ IDEA YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4ogdcPcIAOOMJktgBMhQnQ) on February 16th.  I will give some more details as we get closer but this is going to be a beginner-focused live coding session where we will take a look at building REST APIs. A huge thank you to Mala Gupta for inviting me and I canâ€™t wait for my 2nd time chatting with her. In case you missed it [she interviewed me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUAdUOZk9E) for IntelliJâ€™s 20th anniversary.

I also want to let you know that I will be a host on Tanzu Tuesday this week. In [this week's episode](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/tv/tanzu-tuesdays/0083/), the great Sam Brannen will talk with us about testing with Spring and JUnit 5. This session will be hands-on with live coding to give you an overview of the latest and greatest in the world of testing using JUnit Jupiter (a.k.a. JUnit 5) and the Spring Framework.

Iâ€™m going to do a lot more live streaming so stay tuned to this newsletter or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/therealdanvega) to find out when Iâ€™m going live. If you would like me to speak at your user group, conference, podcast, or join you on a live coding session please feel free to reach out to me.

I canâ€™t even begin to tell you how excited I am to be a VMware. It was a great first week and look forward to many more.

## Nuxt 3 + Notion API

If you pay attention to anything Iâ€™m doing you probably know that I am a huge fan of Notion. I use it as a single source of truth for running my life. I schedule out all of my newsletters, YouTube videos, blog posts, courses and so much more.

If you have been following my [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZV0a2jwt22tlxgTQ3ZB2KpRtDTl2K0IP) on Nuxt 3 you know Iâ€™m planning on moving my personal website over to the framework this year. Something that I have wanted for a while is a way for you to vote on the content you would like to see me produce next. A lot of the time I am just creating content around the work Iâ€™m doing or things that Iâ€™m interested in. I would like to put some ideas out there and let you vote on what I should work on next.

For that to work through all of the ideas will be created and updated inside of Notion. Lucky for us Notion has an API and a way for us to work with that data. I created a tutorial on how you could create a full-stack application with Nuxt 3 that talks to the Notion API.

If youâ€™re a Spring Boot fan, I have some content coming around using the Notion API in your Spring applications coming soon.

## Kubernetes Documentary

The Kubernetes documentary created by Honeypot was released this week. They do such an amazing job with these documentaries and I have been looking forward to this one for a long time. It was fascinating to see how Kubernetes started and a behind-the-scenes look at the container wars. If you havenâ€™t seen this one it is a must-watch ðŸ¤©

What was even crazier is that after watching this I was in a meeting with one of the creators of Kubernetes at VMware. If you didnâ€™t know 2 of the creators work at VMware. Did I tell you how much I love working for this company!

## JChampions Conference

The 2nd Annual JChampions Conference wrapped up last week and wow, what a conference it was. You will be hard-pressed to find a collection of Java developers like this one at any conference. If you want to see the recordings for all of the talks you can watch them on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChJ6IHM_uy6dWLBiDAwYkpw/videos).

## Spring Developer Advocate Goodies

Now that I get to focus on Spring and the community I should have more goodies to share with you every week. This week I have some really great recordings from a few of my teammates:

- [Josh Long - Kubernetes Native Java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-4RQ7LXZUk)
- [Cora Iberkleid - Building Production Ready Container Images at Scale](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/tv/tanzu-tuesdays/0082/)
- [Code: Cartographer with Josh Long and Cora Iberkleid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=694soIproYE)
- [Between Chair and Keyboard: The one with Spencer Gibb](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/tv/bcak/52/)

If you havenâ€™t had a chance to visit the [VMware Tanzu Developer Center](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/) I suggest you check it out. Itâ€™s packed full of free content.

## Until Next Week

Thanks for sitting down and sharing a cup of coffee with me my friend. I hope you enjoyed this installment of Coffee & Code and I will see you next Monday morning. If you have any links you would like me to include please [contact me](http://twitter.com/therealdanvega) and I might add them to a future newsletter. I hope you have a great week and as always friends...

Happy Coding<br/>
