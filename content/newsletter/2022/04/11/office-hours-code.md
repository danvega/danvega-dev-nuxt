Happy Monday, friends! It’s crazy to think that we are heading into the middle of April already. Here in the Vega household it’s been a rough couple of weeks. We have all been sick with a number of bugs going around but we are hoping this is the end of it. This is the main reason you haven’t seen any videos from me lately and I’m hoping to get back to that in a few weeks.

This will be my last newsletter for a few weeks. Next week the family and I are heading to Hilton Head for some R&R and the following week I will be in Chicago for the [SpringOne Tour](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/springone-tour/2022/chicago/).

## Office Hours

Below is a recording from our latest office hours live stream. This is a chance for you to find out what is the latest news in the world of Spring, learn something new and ask any questions you might have. Up until this point DaShaun and I have just been testing this format out. We are happy to announce that this show is going pro and it will be added to the [Tanzu TV portfolio](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/tv/) soon.

## Tanzu TV - Code: Spring for GraphQL

In this episode of Code I’m talking all about Spring for GraphQL. I am working on my presentation for the SpringOne Tour and I began working on some of my demo’s in this live stream.

## Discord Server

If you didn’t know I started a community a discord a couple years ago. I honestly haven’t been giving it the attention it needs. A week or two ago I decided to shut down the server without much warning. I made this decision because I need to make sure I am spending my time wisely. This was another medium that wasn’t providing the value I envisioned when I started it.

If I am being completely honest, I’m just not a big fan of Discord. This is both from a user and server admin point of view. There are a lot of things I just don’t like about it but I don’t want to get into here.

## Thank You 🙏

A friend sent me the message below out of nowhere one day. Just another reminder that it is really easy to say something positive to someone. It takes only a couple of minutes but it could really make their day and put them in a better mood. Thank you friend for the kind words 🤩

> The past couple days, I have been fixed on the concept of people wanting to be the noun without doing the verb. I thought this blog post was awesome and communicates it very well.

> I want to know, I think you are doing an amazing job of being the verb by producing awesome content. Keep up the great work.
