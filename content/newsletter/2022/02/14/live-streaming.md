Itâ€™s Monday, February 14th and I am once again petitioning for the day after the Super Bowl to be a national holiday. Iâ€™m writing this before the game takes place so I donâ€™t know how it ends. Iâ€™m just hoping for a good game and a great halftime show. In this week's edition of the newsletter, I want to talk about Live Streaming, Netlify Serverless Functions, Vue 3, and The Dropout.

## Live Streaming

In my new role as a Spring Developer Advocate, I am going to be presenting a lot more this year. I already have a bunch of virtual events lined up including one this week. On Wednesday, February 16th I will be speaking with Mala Gupta at JetBrains. In this session, I will be talking about building REST APIs with Spring Boot.

As much experience as I have with creating and editing videos I donâ€™t have a ton of experience live streaming or presenting virtually. With that, I thought I would start practicing last week and I ended up live streaming 3 times which is probably more action than my Twitch channel has ever seen.

My main goal was just to get used to the software and work out any issues. I am a big fan of [Ecamm](https://www.ecamm.com/) and I want to use the software to stream with but I keep having issues with it. There are times when it works fine and there are other times where the audio gets out of sync and for the life of me I canâ€™t figure it out. This even happens when I use the record-only mode. I thought after getting my [brand new MacBook](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2021/11/15/macbook-pro-m1-max-review/) that this would go away but unfortunately, it didnâ€™t. If anyone knows what would cause this please let me know.

I also used Streamyard for the first time this week and was happy with it. We have a group account for this at work and I will also be using this on my stream this Wednesday. I wish it was as customizable as Ecamm but on the other hand, I didnâ€™t have any audio issues. Iâ€™m still trying to find a good way to play background music on Streamyard. I think I found a solution using [Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) but I am still testing that out.

You can find the 3 live stream recordings below. If youâ€™re not already following me on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/danvega) or [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/danvega) please do to be notified when I go live next.

As far as what I did in the live streams, I will cover that in the next section.

## Netlify Serverless Functions

Throughout the live streams I mentioned above I was trying to solve a real problem that I have. With all of these speaking appearances, I have scheduled this year I need a way to display them on my website.

If you follow anything I do you know I am a huge fan of Notion. I keep everything I do in Notion so naturally, I would like to store all of my conferences, user group meetups, and live streams in one place. I started with just a list of upcoming live streams and using the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/) I was able to pull all of them into a page on my website.

The next question becomes how do you do that when youâ€™re using a frontend framework like Vue. My website is a static generated website using Gridsome + Vue. You donâ€™t want to make API calls from a frontend because you can expose your authentication / API secrets. I could stand up a backend with something like Node or Java but that seems like a lot for such a simple task. This is a perfect use case for serverless functions.

I was able to do this thanks to [Netlify Serverless functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/). With Netlify you can create a directory and any file that exports a handler function gets turned into a serverless function and uploaded to AWS Lambda. I decided to take what I learned from the live streams and created a simple tutorial on how I used a Netlify function to connect to the Notion API.

## Vue 3 Documentation

If you havenâ€™t been paying attention the [Vue 3 docs](https://vuejs.org/) have been released. Along with this release Vue 3 has now become the default. If you look in the upper left-hand corner of the documentation you will see an API reference section. This toggle will allow you to switch the docs based on if youâ€™re using the Options or Composition API. I thought that was a really nice touch ðŸŽ‰

## The Dropout

I am fascinated by the story of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos. I read [Bad Blood](https://amzn.to/36eN1GJ) by [John Carreyrou](https://www.amazon.com/John-Carreyrou/e/B07CWLT57D/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1) a few years back and was totally sucked into everything that went on. There was also a really good documentary on HBO about this that I also enjoyed.

Elizabeth Holmes has been in the news lately as she went to trial and was found guilty of defrauding investors. There is a new show coming to Hulu called the dropout which has an incredible cast.

## Nuxt 3

This was a really great Twitter thread by SÃ©bastien Chopin on where we are with Nuxt 3. I am obviously paying close attention to this because Iâ€™m hoping to move my website over to Nuxt 3 this year.
