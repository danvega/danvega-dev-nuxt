Hello friends and welcome to another edition of the newsletter. This edition is coming to you a day late and as I write this I am sitting in Seattle for another [SpringOne Tour](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/springone-tour/2022/seattle/). I‚Äôm having a great time in Seattle and I will tell you more about this stop in the next version of the newsletter.

In this edition of the newsletter, I want to talk about SpringOne Tour NYC, A Bootiful Podcast, 2 new videos for YouTube, and a conference recording.

## SpringOne Tour New York City

I had the opportunity to spend a week in NYC with my entire team for the 1st time since joining VMware. It was so great to have everyone in one place and I learned so much on this trip. I gave my talk on Getting Started with GraphQL and I thought it went really well I received some great questions from the audience.

After my talk, I was able to attend a bunch of sessions and I learned so much. One session that I was excited to see was on the new [Spring CLI](https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-cli) from Mark Pollack. This is an experimental project at the moment but it solves a real problem that other communities have solutions for.

The Spring CLI will help increase productivity when creating new projects or adding functionality to existing projects. You can read through the documentation to learn more but I plan on creating some content in the new future about this exciting project.

What was really exciting for me is that I had a chance to sit down with Mark and do some pair programming. After about an hour I was able to create a new GraphQL project that you can use with the Spring CLI. Again if that doesn‚Äôt make sense, I‚Äôll have more on that soon!

## A Bootiful Podcast with Josh Long

I had the opportunity to sit down with my friend and coworker Josh Long for an episode of his podcast. We had a chance to talk about my career and how I ended up where I am today. It‚Äôs always fun reflecting on my career and I can‚Äôt wait for you to hear our conversation.

## YouTube

I was able to create 2 videos over the last 2 weeks. It‚Äôs crazy that in one week I am able to create 3 videos and some weeks I don‚Äôt create any. I guess that is the life of being a YouTuber though, consistency is the key to the whole game.

### Testing your GraphQL APIs

I have been creating a lot of content around Spring for GraphQL lately and one of the questions that keep coming up is how can I test my APIs. The testing support in Spring for GraphQL out of the box is really good and easy to get started with. In this tutorial, you will learn how to write a slice test and the GraphQL Tester that includes a fluent API for testing your APIs independent of the server transport.

### IntelliJ Live Templates for Spring Boot

If you aren‚Äôt aware the Spring Developer Advocacy team started a [Spring Developers Twitter Community](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1496544801533091844). There are so many great questions in that community and my plan is to start answering questions there. In this video, I answer my friend DaShaun‚Äôs question on how to quickly automate some one-liners in Spring Boot.

## What‚Äôs new in Nuxt 3

I gave a talk at VueConf US in June on What is new in Nuxt 3. That conference was such a great time and I thought my talk went well. Now you can be the judge of that now that the recording is online. Thanks to the fine folks over at Vue Mastery for making it available. If you don‚Äôt have a subscription to them you should consider signing up.
