Happy Spring Forward! Yesterday those of us who have to live under daylight savings moved our clocks forward 1 hour. I look forward to this day as soon as it starts getting cold outside. This day signals to me that winter is almost over and days get longer with the sun setting later.

This is going to be a short newsletter because last week was busy for me personally. My wife was on vacation so I was on solo dad duty Thursday morning to Sunday night. I survived but I will say I don’t know how you single parents do it, especially those with younger kids. You deserve an award on a weekly basis.

## What’s new in Spring Boot 2.6

I put together my first video for the Spring Developer YouTube channel last week. This was exciting for me because it was the first video I created for something outside of my personal channel. Not to mention, the Spring Developer channel had 168k subscribers at the time I posted the video.

In this tutorial, you will learn about what has changed and what’s new in Spring Boot 2.6. With each release, we publish a set of release notes. You could spend the time to go through these but I often find it easier to absorb when the features are associated with a demo and that’s exactly what I did with this video.

I wasn’t able to go through every single feature because there were so many so I picked out what I thought were the major or interesting changes. The video ended up being a little over an hour but don’t let that scare you as I have included timestamps so you can jump to a particular feature.

I really hope you enjoy this video and if a particular feature I didn’t go through and you want to see a demo on it please reach out. I learned that keeping up with each of the major releases and really understanding what changed and why and what is new is a great way to stay up to date with Spring Boot.

I also want to thank everyone who watched this video and helped me spread the word on social media. This video ended up with 9,000 views in 1 day and 20,000 views in a 3-day span. Easily my most popular video ever out of the gate. This just gives me more of a desire to grow my own YouTube channel so that I can help more people out.

## Office Hours

Last week my coworker DaShaun and I ran the first episode of what we are calling Office Hours. We both noticed a need for developers in the Spring Community to have a place where they could ask questions and learn something new.

We are still working on the cadence and what the format of the show looks like but for now, we will cover:

1. Announcements
2. Demos
3. Questions

If you want you can check out the [recording of episode #1](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1418342200). If you want to catch our next episode that will happen Tuesday, March 15 at 10:30 AM EDT on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/danvega). We are both really excited about this and we would love your feedback on it.

## Until Next Week
