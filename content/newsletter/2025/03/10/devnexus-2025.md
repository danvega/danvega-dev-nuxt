Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of the newsletter. It has been a busy few weeks for me giving presentations at conferences, for customers and some online meetups.

## ConFoo

This was my 2nd year attending and speaking at ConFoo and I absolutely love this conference. The food, sessions, conversations and people were all amazing. I was lucky to give 2 presentations at this conference and I thought they both went really well. The first was on AI-Powered Dev Hacks and it was an opportunity to share how I am using AI in my day-to-day workflows. If you want to check out the slides or a quick overview of the talk you can check out [my blog post](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/ai-powered-dev-hacks-confoo-2025) on this.

The 2nd talk was an introduction to Spring AI and I absolutely love giving this talk. I gave a bit of an introduction to Artificial Intelligence and then went in to showing the value of Spring AI. If you're interested in this presentation keep reading because I will be giving a version of it later this week.

## DevNexus

Last week I had the opportunity to head to Atlanta and attend DevNexus. This is one of my favorite conferences for Java developers. The vendors, speakers, sessions and hallway tracks are all so great. I love catching up with so many developers from the Java community and this for me is one of those can't miss conferences.

I had the opportunity to give a talk on how to navigate the frontend landscape. This was an overview for Java developers who all of a sudden need to create a frontend for an application and are curious as to what your options are. The frontend development space is fast paced and always changing so this was my chance to give an overview of what technologies you should focus on in 2025. I had some really good feedback on this talk and I really appreciate everyone who attended my talk.

While we were there DaShaun and I had an opportunity to record an episode of Spring Office Hours live.

While I was on the road I had an opportunity to give a couple of a presentations. One was a workshop on Spring AI and this ended up being a really great talk, well attended and some amazing questions. As I got ready for this talk I took the opportunity to update my [Spring AI Workshop Repository](https://github.com/danvega/spring-ai-workshop) to the latest milestone and added a bunch of really great examples.

## Upcoming Presentations

- This week I will be giving a [talk](https://www.meetup.com/virtualjug/events/306414120/) to the Virtual Java User Group (vJUG) on Spring AI. In this talk I will give you a quick introduction to AI and where Spring AI helps you solve some of the problems that will come up when you start building real world applications.
- Next week I will be in California for [JavaOne](https://www.oracle.com/javaone/) and I will be giving my talk on navigating the frontend landscape for Java Developers.

As always if you're interested in where I am speaking next you can always check out the [speaking page](https://www.danvega.dev/speaking) on my website for upcoming and past presentations.

## Notion Spring Boot Starter

I am a huge fan of Notion and use it for almost everything in both my personal and professional life. I have put together some tutorials in the past on integrating with Notion but it was very much a manual process.

I decided to sit down with my robot friends and build out a Spring Boot Starter that I could use in any application that need to interact with Notion. What we came up with was the first version of a [Notion Spring Boot Starter](https://github.com/danvega/notion-spring-boot-starter). There is some information in the readme on how to get started with it but I will build this out more as I start to put together some samples.

I'm starting with the idea of a content calendar and if you want to pull this information into your Spring Application you could pull in this Notion Starter and it would be fairly easy read and write to that database. If this sounds like something you're interested in please let me know. Also if you could let me know what types of integrations you're working on it will help me out when putting some samples together.
