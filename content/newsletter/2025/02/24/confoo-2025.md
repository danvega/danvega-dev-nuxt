Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of the newsletter. We are entering the last week of February and I am all for it. I don‚Äôt mind the cold or the snow but when we get into late February I am just over it. I‚Äôm hitting the road for 3 out of the next 4 weeks and I‚Äôm excited to connect with the community.

I have been pretty swamped lately preparing for all my upcoming talks, so I haven‚Äôt released any videos on the YouTube channel but I will get back to that and answering your questions as soon as I can.

I‚Äôm also preparing for a 3-hour workshop on Spring AI and I‚Äôm going to use a lot of that material to create a big introduction for YouTube. I‚Äôm expecting that video to be in the 3-4 hour range and I‚Äôll let you know more about that as soon as I start working on it.

## ConFoo

This week I‚Äôm heading to Montreal, CA for [ConFoo](https://confoo.ca/en/2025). Last year was my first year at the conference and I really enjoyed it. The people were awesome, the talks were great and the food was amazing. It was also my first time in Montreal and I really enjoyed seeing the city and the unground cities underneath the city.

I‚Äôm giving 2 talks at the conference and the first one is all about using AI in your day-to-day workflows. This is a brand-new talk, and I am really excited about this. This talk isn‚Äôt just how to use ChatGPT or IDE extensions to write code. I go into some practical use cases that I‚Äôm using to be more productive every day.

The 2nd talk is about using Generative AI in your Java applications with Spring AI. I have given this talk before, but I updated it for the conference with less slides and all new examples to go through. I am packing in a lot of great content in 45 minutes and I‚Äôm looking forward to this presentation.

If you‚Äôre going to be at ConFoo please say hello üëãüèª

## Moving Java Forward

Last week was a special Spring Office Hours as we got to sit and talk with my good friend Sharat Chander. We talked about all things Java, Community and upcoming conferences that we will all be at like DevNexus and JavaOne. If you didn‚Äôt get a chance to catch this live, the replay of the podcast you can check it out below.

## Spring AI

Last week was a huge week for the Spring AI team. They announced the availability of [Spring AI 1.0.0 M6](https://spring.io/blog/2025/02/14/spring-ai-1-0-0-m6-released) along with the official [SDK Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Java](https://spring.io/blog/2025/02/14/mcp-java-sdk-released-2). The Spring AI team worked closely with the folks at Anthropic to make this happen and this is really exciting to see. If you haven‚Äôt had a chance to check out MCP and what it can do you for this is a really good time to jump on in.

## Speaking

Conference season is in full swing over here. I‚Äôm going to ConFoo this week, DevNexus next week and JavaOne on March 18th. I was also able to submit some proposals to Spring I/O in Barcelona and KCDC so I will be crossing my fingers for those.  If you want to keep up to date with my speaking engagements you can check out the [speaking page](https://www.danvega.dev/speaking) on my website.

**TWEETS**

Grok 3 was released last week and so far I have been pretty happy with it

This had to be the coolest announcement of last week.
