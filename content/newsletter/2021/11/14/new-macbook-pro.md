After missing a week due to mostly not having anything to talk to you about I'm back with the newsletter so let's do it. First, we celebrated Veterans Day here in the US this week and I just want to take this opportunity to thank anyone who has or is serving. Your sacrifice and commitment to this country are greatly appreciated.

## MacBook Pro

I ordered my new MacBook Pro the day after the announcement event and I kid you not I have been checking the tracking updates every day since then. This week it finally arrived and I was excited to get it in my hands and test it out. Here is a shot of it still in the box in front of my Cleveland print in my office.

Before it arrived I had all of these plans to create videos for my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/danvega) on how I set up a new machine as a developer. I always found those types of videos useful and I thought I might be able to help others find new tools or just learn something new.

Mapping out each of those videos would take a long time though and I just wanted to get it set up and start using it and can you blame me? What I did though was document each of the steps I took to set up my new laptop and put it on Github. I am going to use this and my review of the MacBook Pro and create a video and or blog post on my setup soon.

Full review coming soon but here are a few notes:

- I love the 14" size, it's a little heavier and I honestly I appreciate that.
- The display is amazing and no the notch doesn't bother me at all.
- When you open the laptop it powers on and responds to you instantly.
- The keyboard is new and so far it's been a great experience. Usually, I prefer using my external keyboard (Apple Magic Keyboard) but I actually prefer typing on this one.
- I was never a fan of the touch bar and I am happy to see the physical keys return.
    - The lower `Fn` key also serves as an Emoji Picker ü•≥
- Ports - I was really happy to see the 3 USB-C ports, SD, HDMI, and MagSafe.
- The battery performance has been really good so far.
- Performance - Everything just feels smooth, fast, and snappy.

Speaking of performance I sent out this tweet this week. I pulled down the Spring Pet Clinic project and I was able to run it in 1.95 seconds.

## Github Copilot

In my last newsletter, I talked about Github Copilot for Java Developers. Since then I wrote a [blog post](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2021/11/08/github-copilot-java-developers/) and [created a video](https://youtu.be/97C3fQqzj-I) tutorial. It's pretty crazy how good Github Copilot can recommend lines or even entire methods.
