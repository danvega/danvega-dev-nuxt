Hello friends,

After a long absence from the newsletter I am excited to be back and writing to you. The reason I started this newsletter is because I enjoy writing and this keeps me doing so on weekly basis. I ended up stopping in March of 2020 right when the pandemic hit and until recently I honestly didn't feel like writing. The last year and half was tough on me mentally but we won't get into that here.

The week started out great with a [Victory Monday](https://twitter.com/therealdanvega/status/1439945285371891712) as my Cleveland Browns got a win on Sunday. The game was at home and I was able to attend my first sporting event in a long long time which was exciting.

## SpringOne 2021

I recently gave a presentation at SpringOne on full-stack development with Spring Boot and VueJS. The recording for that talk has been posted on the [Spring Developer YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkrGHqwSPVA&t=1866s). If you didn't happen to catch it live there was a problem with Zoom and I ended up presenting to myself for about four minutes. If you notice a little bit of a gap, that is why. I put together this blog post that contains more info about the presentation along with links to the slides and code.

## YouTube

This week I put together a tutorial on a cool project called Java Faker. This project allows you to create sample data, quickly and easily. I build a lot of demos and I often need some good data to test out certain functionality. In this tutorial I create a simple Spring Boot application and use Faker to populate 200 records in my H2 database.

## Currently Reading

I'm currently reading a new book, [Building Microservices 2nd Edition by Sam Newman](https://amzn.to/3AC45k8). Sam is an amazing author and speaker and I have been looking forward to getting into this book for awhile. I'm currently in the first section of the book titled "What are Microservices". I thought Sam's description of Microservices was succinct.

> Microservices are independently releasable services that are modeled around a business domain. A service encapsulates functionality and makes it accessible to other services via networks—you construct a more complex system from these building blocks.

I have spent a lot of time in Microservices this year and its an architectural pattern that I am continuing to expand my knowledge on. I will share more with you as I make my way through this book but in the meantime I threw this out on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/therealdanvega) this week, what books are you currently reading?
