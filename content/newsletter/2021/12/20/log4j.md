Welcome to what might very well be the last installment of the newsletter in 2021. I only have a few days left of work for the year and honestly, I don't think I will have much to talk about. I am working on a couple of exciting things for the new year and I can't wait to share those with you. In this week's edition of the newsletter we continue our conversation about the Log4J2 Vulnerability.

## Are your Spring Boot Applications vulnerable to the Log4J2 Exploit?

In last week's newsletter, I mentioned the Log4J Vulnerability that was going around. I had some more time at the beginning of the week to dig into it and more specifically if we were affected at work. This brought up a lot of questions around how logging works in Spring Boot so I thought I would go through some of that here.

The biggest thing you need to know from a Spring Boot standpoint is that if you don't deviate from the default configuration you are safe. Let's start out with how logging works out of the box. When you add a dependency like `web (spring-boot-starter-web)` that will bring in the `spring-boot-starter` which brings in `spring-boot-starter-logging.` If you run `mvn dependency:tree` you will see something that looks like this:

```bash
[INFO] +- org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web:jar:2.6.1:compile
[INFO] |  +- org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter:jar:2.6.1:compile
[INFO] |  |  +- org.springframework.boot:spring-boot:jar:2.6.1:compile
[INFO] |  |  +- org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-autoconfigure:jar:2.6.1:compile
[INFO] |  |  +- org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-logging:jar:2.6.1:compile
[INFO] |  |  |  +- ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:jar:1.2.7:compile
[INFO] |  |  |  |  \- ch.qos.logback:logback-core:jar:1.2.7:compile
[INFO] |  |  |  +- org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-to-slf4j:jar:2.14.1:compile
[INFO] |  |  |  |  \- org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api:jar:2.14.1:compile
```

Spring Boot uses SLF4J which is a facade that builds on top of logging frameworks like Logback and Log4J2. If you take a look at the dependencies in `spring-boot-starter-logging` you will notice that `logback-classic` is the first dependency.

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
    <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.7</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>log4j-to-slf4j</artifactId>
    <version>2.14.1</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>jul-to-slf4j</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.32</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

If we go back to that tree view there are 2 dependencies with the name log4j in them. I want to make sure we are clear here, these 2 dependencies by themselves will not make you vulnerable to the exploit.  You need to also have the `log4j-core.jar` on the classpath and current it is not.

```bash

[INFO] |  |  |  +- org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-to-slf4j:jar:2.14.1:compile
[INFO] |  |  |  |  \- org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api:jar:2.14.1:compile


```

### Switching to Log4J2

So if we aren‚Äôt vulnerable by default, what actions will make us open to this exploit and how do we fix it. Remember that by default the `spring-boot-starter` will bring our `spring-boot-logging` starter that configures Logback for us. If you want to use a different framework like Log4J2, you need to first exclude the logging starter. Next you can include the `spring-boot-starter-log4j2` which will configure Log4J2.

```bash
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
      <exclusions>
          <exclusion>
              <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
              <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-logging</artifactId>
          </exclusion>
      </exclusions>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-log4j2</artifactId>
  </dependency>

</dependencies>
```

This will result in the `log4j-core` dependency which is now going to make us vulnerable to the exploit.

```bash
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>log4j-core</artifactId>
  <version>2.14.1</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

This doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt use Log4J2, it just means you can‚Äôt use that specific version. Anything < `2.15.0` is vulnerable and at the time of writing this newsletter the current version is `2.17.0`. All you need to do to bump the version is to add a new property to the properties section in your `pom.xml` that defines the version of Log4j2 that you want to use.

```bash
<properties>
    <java.version>17</java.version>
    <log4j2.version>2.17.0</log4j2.version>
</properties>
```

### Spring Boot Log4J2 Vulnerability Video

Everything that we just talked about here is in the video below.

As a small YouTuber you need to try and jump on trends as they are happening. I know these are numbers are all relative but for me it was best performing video of all time in the first 1,3, and 5 days. At the time of this writing I have had over 2,000 views in the first 5 videos. If you were one of those 2,000 viewers, thank you!
