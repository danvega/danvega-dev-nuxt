Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, Dan Vega for the week of Mar 1 - Mar 7, 2020.  This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you don't already have one grab a cup and your favorite beverage and let's get to it.

## Previous Week

The news this week was dominated by the Coronavirus and rightfully so. My Twitter timeline was filled with news of so many conferences canceling. While it was probably a hard decision for the conference organizers, it was the right one.

Next, I want to say thank you to my friends over at JS & Friends Conference for mentioning me in the **Developer Community Spotlight**.

### YouTube Channel Updates

I mentioned this last week but to nobody's surprise when you get more consistent with your content you can expect to see improvements in your analytics. I am really encouraged and excited to see these numbers going up and I hope this trend continues. If you have been following along I have some pretty big goals and goal #1 of 10,000 subscribers is insight.

I produced three new videos this week, I hope you enjoy them!

**Spring Boot Quick Start: Spring Boot Tutorial for Beginners**

In this presentation, I am going to talk to you about some of the new and exciting features coming to Vue 3. I originally put this presentation together for a conference here in Ohio called CodeMash. I put a lot of work into this presentation and have only given it twice now so I decided to sit down and record it for YouTube.

**Vue 3: Smaller, Faster & Stronger**

**Creating Your First Github Pull Request**

In this tutorial, I am going to show you how to create a simple pull request by submitting your first pull request to Github. After we walk through submitting your first pull request to Github I am going to show you how to find issues that you can work on in some of your favorite open-source projects. If you want to contribute on open-source projects these days it is important to understand how to find issues that you can work on and understand the process for getting your changes into a project.
