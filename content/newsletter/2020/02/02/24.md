## Previous Week

Thanks for everyone's feedback on my YouTube thumbnail art. I heard from a couple folks that the font was hard to read so I ended up switch it up to what you see above. With that let's get into this weeks topics.

## Vue.JS for beginners

If you follow me at all you probably already know this but I recently released a new course called [Vue.js for Beginners: Up and Running with Vue](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=zjYBw7lN8X4&event=video_description&redir_token=yQh8clKfvyxIDONs8rOkFaN8zGx8MTU4MDY3MzY3OUAxNTgwNTg3Mjc5&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fvue-intro%2F%3FreferralCode%3DE9DECFF78CA706D7A68A). I haven't really mentioned it to my YouTube audience yet so I thought I would do that this week. I recorded a quick video with my motivation for creating the course and I played the course trailer. If you're interested in watching that video the link is below and If you're not a subscriber on YouTube yet, what are you waiting for ðŸ˜‰

### Stir Trek Call for papers

By the time you're reading this, the call for papers for Stir Trek 2020 has ended. As usual, I waited until the very last minute to submit a talk but I was able to submit one. The title for the talk is "Vue 3: Smaller, Faster & Stronger". This is the talk I gave to CodeMash but I have already made a few updates and if this gets accepted I have some ideas for a few more.

## Upcoming Week

What I have planned for this week...

### Vue 3: Smaller, Faster Stronger

If you're in the Cleveland area I will be giving a presentation on Vue 3. This is the same presentation I gave at CodeMash and I am excited to give it again.

### YouTube Videos

I should have another 2 videos out this week. The first is going to be on building a silly app in Vue called Are You Rob Base. I had a lot of fun building this out and I hope you learn something from it. The 2nd I haven't recorded yet so I don't want to announce it just yet but if you have a topic you would like to see me cover please let me know.
