## Previous Week

It was another busy week for me and I am finally getting back into the swing of things and I finally feel like the new year has finally started. With that let's get into it...

### Vue 3 Fragments Video

[In this tutorial,](https://youtu.be/iC9smVwm7GE) you are going to learn all about a new feature in Vue 3 called Fragments. You will learn about the problem as it exists in Vue 2 and how Vue 3 is making this issue go away.

### Thumbnail Design

The one thing that always stresses me out when I create a new video is the thumbnail. I know they are really important when it comes to YouTube but it takes me way too long to come up with a good design. I started playing with a new design this week that I could reuse for every tutorial and just switch up the theme based on the content. I would love your thoughts on the image above, below and the overall theme.

### New domain name

I am the king of buying new domain names and letting them sit. With that said I bought a new domain this week that I think I am actually going to do something with. The domain is [www.intervue.com](http://www.intervue.com) and my thought is to do some kind of application that helps anyone going for a new job where Vue is the primary framework. There will be questions around HTML, CSS, JavaScript and of course Vue. If you have any interest in this please let me know.
