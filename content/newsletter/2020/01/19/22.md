Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, Dan Vega. This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you missed last week's newsletter you can checkout Coffee and Code #21 [here](https://www.danvega.dev/newsletter/coffee-and-code/21). If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it.

## Previous Week

I'm back! Sorry for taking a few weeks off but I was super busy and I can't wait to tell you all about it. I hope all of your holidays were wonderful and you're all recharged and ready for the new year. I have a bunch to get into so let's do it.

### CodeMash 2020

I was really busy over the holidays preparing for [CodeMash](http://codemash.org). This was my very first time attending and speaking at CodeMash so I had my hands full. This was an amazing conference and I can't recommend it enough. I have two blog posts below that recap both the conference and my talk.

- [Vue 3: Smaller, Faster & Stronger](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2020/01/09/codemash-2020/)
- [CodeMash 2020 Recap](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2020/01/13/codemash-2020-recap/)

### Start using Vue 3 in a project right now (Screencast)

![start-using-vue3-today-cover.png](./start-using-vue3-today-cover.png)

So you've heard of Vue 3 and you want to start playing around with it but not sure where to start. Did you know that you can add Vue 3 to a new project using the Vue CLI? In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a new project using the Vue CLI and then using a new plugin, add Vue 3 Alpha to your project.

With Vue 3 installed we will walk through creating a new component using the Composition API. We will start by creating a simple Counter component and it might be a trivial example it does allow you to see the building blocks of Vue's new Composition API.

### Grammarly Visual Studio Code Extension

![Grammarly_Visual_Studio_Code_Extension.png](./Grammarly_Visual_Studio_Code_Extension.png)

In this tutorial, I am going to show you a new extension that brings Grammarly support to Visual Studio Code. Personally, I have been interested in Grammarly for Code for a long time now so you can imagine how excited I was to find out someone released an extension.

I will walk through how to find it, install it, use it and how you can customize it. I also show another extension that you might need to disable to get this to work properly. I have only been using Grammarly for Visual Studio Code for a few days now but it's already become one of my favorite extensions.

### 7,000+ YouTube Subscribers

I hit another big milestone this week as I crossed 7,000 subscribers on YouTube. I want to thank all of you for subscribing and if you haven't yet, what are you waiting for ðŸ˜‰I uploaded two more videos this week and it's a constant learning process for me. I don't have a big room with natural light so I am always experimenting with new ways to record tutorials. If you have any feedback for me or tutorials you would like to see please don't hesitate reaching out.
