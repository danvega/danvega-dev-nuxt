Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of the newsletter. If you follow me you know this weekend was a big one for me as we hit Daylight Savings which is a big milestone around here. This means that our days are going to get longer, and it will stay light out later. This means it will start to get warmer here (it already has) and that long days of winter are over.

Seasonal depression is a real thing, and I’m excited to get back to running outside. This also means I will be able to start golfing again, and I’m very excited about that. I tell you this because it makes me happy and I think we should all celebrate whatever makes us happy.

Today I want to share want to share with you a resource for learning spring, tell you that Java is **NOT** slow and verbose.

## Resources for learning Spring

Last week on [Spring Office Hours](https://spring-office-hours.transistor.fm/episodes/spring-office-hours-s3e8-resources-for-learning-spring) we built out a list of resources for learning Spring live on the show. It was a lot of fun because we got to collaborate with the audience and we put a pretty solid list together in an hour.

After the show I took what we did and turned it into a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/spring-office-hours/resources-learning-spring) complete with categories and links to all the resources we discussed. When I was done with it I let everyone know that PRs are welcomed, and we got a lot of really great additions to the repo.

I also thought it might be a good idea to have a bookmarks file that you could just import into your browser and get all of these great links. I was able to manually put this together, but I would really love to find a way to automate this.

Finally, I have been on GitHub forever and I think the most stars a repo of mine has ever seen is 335. As of the time of writing this on Sunday night we have 420 stars on the repo which is just crazy considering it’s not even a week old yet. Thank you to everyone for the contributions and support, and we are going to talk more about this on this week's episode of Office Hours.

## Java is slow and verbose

I've worked with JVM for most of my 23-year career, and it seems like every week someone declares Java as dead, calling it ancient, verbose, and slow. However, these claims couldn't be further from the truth.

Such comments often come from people who haven't written any Java since their introductory computer science course 20 years ago. Yes, Java has evolved over the years, but that's expected of a language that has been around for 28 years. The world relies heavily on Java, and it remains one of the most popular programming languages, regardless of the metric or survey you consider.

I decided to make a video talking about some features that make Java fast and concise.

## YouTube Studio

I have been really unhappy with some of my recent videos because I felt like they haven’t been looking good. Mainly I thought I had some lighting issues and I decided it was time to fix them. The best way I could think of doing this is to pull a lot of stuff out of my office and start with a blank cavas.

This meant to turn off all the lights and start introducing lights to see if I could get a better result than I was before. Here is an example of the before and after.
