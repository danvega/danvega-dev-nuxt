Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of the newsletter. It is really hard to believe that it is the middle of December. Well now that I think about it the weather has been extremely cold so itâ€™s not that hard to believe. My family and I had a brunch with Santa even over the weekend and the girls absolutely loved it. Iâ€™m not a fan of this cold weather we have right now but I love seeing the girls happy so it makes everything worth it.

In todayâ€™s newsletter I want to start off by talking about some of the common mistakes we make as Spring Developers. From there we will dive into a productivity hack that I have been using when working with Large Language Models that has been a real time saver. Iâ€™ll share with you a conversation I had with Siva Reddy last week on Spring Office hours and my move to Figma for YouTube Thumbnail designs. I hope you have an amazing week as we start to close out the year!

## Spring Common Mistakes

Last week I gave a presentation for the [Software Craft Community at Datev](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/datev-software-craft-community) on common mistakes Spring Developers make. I have talked about a few of these mistakes before but this is the first time that I put a bunch of them into presentation format. I actually have a ton of material on this and if we did a little more live coding this would probably be about a 2 hour presentation.

I want to thank Datev for having me and allowing me to ramble and for everyone who attended and asked so many great questions. If youâ€™re interested in a deeper dive on this let me know, Iâ€™m considering making a series out of this for the YouTube channel.

## The Best AI Productivity Hack


I want to share a productivity tip that's transformed my AI workflow: [using voice dictation instead of typing](https://www.bytesizedai.dev/p/ai-productivity-hack). Rather than spending time crafting elaborate written prompts for tools like ChatGPT and Claude, I use my computer's built-in dictation feature (activated with a simple keyboard shortcut) to speak naturally to AI models.

The setup is straightforward â€“ enable dictation in your system settings, choose a microphone, and assign a keyboard shortcut. For best results, use a quality microphone and structure your thoughts before speaking. The real power comes from treating AI interactions like conversations, iterating through dialogue rather than trying to craft perfect prompts.

I find this especially useful for content creation, technical documentation, and problem-solving discussions. The best part? It works anywhere there's a text input box, making it a universal tool for faster, more natural AI interactions. This simple change has saved me countless hours and made working with AI feel as natural as talking to a colleague.

## IntelliJ Tips and Tricks with Siva

It was great to chat with Siva Reddy, Developer Advocate at JetBrains last week on [Spring Office Hours](https://spring-office-hours.transistor.fm/episodes/s3e42-intellij-tips-tricks-with-siva-reddy). In this episode we talked with Siva about being a Developer Advocate, Spring & IntelliJ. I really enjoyed our conversation and I hope you will too.

## YouTube Thumbnail Designs


I have used Adobe XD for designing my YouTube thumbnails for as long as I can remember. I use it because I have a subscription to the Creative Cloud Applications and its always just worked for me. Well Adobe is really no longer updating this software and when I got my new laptop I decided it was time to install and learn Figma.

I am not a designer but I find tools like this are easy to learn and I enjoy using them. The thumbnails I create are nothing special but I do try and make them nice. In macOS you can go into your photos app and find a image and copy the subject so I get a nice headshot of myself without the background and then paste that into my thumbnail. From there I try to use big text with simple backgrounds and add any little touches I can to it.

Here is my current thumbnail design board for some upcoming videos.
