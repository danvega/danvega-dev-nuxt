Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of the newsletter. Even before I became a ‚Äúcontent creator‚Äù I was fascinated by the office tours on YouTube. How were creators utilizing the space they had and what were all the cool gear they were using. I have had a lot of fun over the years trying to improve my office space and we coming up on another makeover.

I decided it was time to upgrade the office and this past weekend was step 1 in that process. If you look at a vide from last weekend you can see this cream color wall behind me. It is pretty boring and honestly just dulls the video for me.

We decided paint the whole office and making that wall behind me a feature wall with a different color. The color we decided to go with is a navy blue from Sherwin Williams called ‚ÄúIn the Navy‚Äù. Here is that same wall after a fresh coat of a paint with the blank shelf. It is extremely time consuming unloading and loading books on to this thing ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

And here is what the background will look like in a video. It‚Äôs crazy how a single color can totally transform the shot like this but I am really happy with how this turned out. What do you think?

I also decided to get a new desk. I have had this IKEA desk hack for what seems like forever now and it‚Äôs time to move on. I was looking for a large standing desk and after doing some searching I decided to go with the Uplift Standing desk. This desk is 72‚Äùx30‚Äù and the finish is Heritage Oak.

## Spring Office Hours

This week on Spring Office Hours I‚Äôm excited to sit down with Nelson Djalo, founder of Amigoscode, to discuss the art of continuous learning and teaching Spring. In this episode, the we‚Äôll explore Nelson's journey from software engineer to influential educator, diving into his unique approach to teaching Spring and DevOps. Discover valuable insights on staying current in the fast-paced world of software development, and learn how Nelson's platform is helping millions break into tech.

## Spring AI

There was a bunch of news related to Spring AI last week. First off the Spring Initializr now includes the [document reader starters](https://x.com/therealdanvega/status/1846561630491992439). There is also a new [Chat Model Comparison](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/chat/comparison.html) matrix in the documentation that I think you‚Äôre really going to enjoy.

I created some new videos last week:

### AI for Java Developers

I wanted to show off how to get started with AI for Java Developers. If you want to call a Large Language Model there are REST APIs that you can call from the command line or a simple Java Application. Once you start building real world applications though a framework like Spring AI really helps you by solving a lot of the problems you are going to run into.

### Calling Multiple LLMs

Learn how to integrate multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) in a single Java application using Spring AI. This tutorial demonstrates how to use both OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the same Spring Boot project.

Speaking of Spring AI I had a really great meeting with the team last week. I am going to help out with some resources for the community and I can‚Äôt wait to share those with you. Stay Tuned!

## Tweets

Last week I worked on some graphics for a RAG video coming out

## THE REST

It appears that [my presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmbQGImXwvA) from ConnectTech last year has been posted to YouTube. If you‚Äôre interested in learning how I build a blog on top of Vue 3 / Nuxt 3 and Notion this presentation is right up your alley.

## UNTIL NEXT WEEK

I hope you enjoyed this newsletter installment, and I will talk to you in the next one. If you have any questions for me or topics you would like me to cover please feel free to reply to this email or reach out to me on [Twitter](https://x.com/therealdanvega) (I‚Äôm not calling it X).

Happy Coding,
Dan Vega
