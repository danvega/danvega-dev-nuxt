Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of the newsletter. This week I'm getting my new MacBook Pro and my plan was to live stream my setup. I would love to do this, but I also realize what a time commitment that would be and I have a lot of things that have to take priority this week. If I have time you will get notified if you're subscribed to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danvega) but if I don't I will take notes and share my setup with you.

I want to share a little bit more of what I have been using AI for lately. I was able to publish 2 new videos last week on Spring Security and Spring Data and I will tell you a little bit about those.

## Generating GitHub Readme Documentation

If you're new around here I am really into AI and how it can help increase productivity. I will admit that when I first introduced to AI I thought it was just another gimmick. I would run off to ChatGPT, ask a question and get a decent response. Now I see it as the ultimate Swiss Army Knife that I can use to be a more productive developer.

I have talked about [Claude Projects](https://www.youtube.com/@danvega), but I don't think I have gone deep on them before. I like using each project and setting the custom instructions to streamline my workflows.

I wanted to share a time-saving workflow I've been using lately that's completely changed how I handle documentation for my demo projects. Last week, I made a video about this because I think it could help many of you who regularly create and share code repositories.

Here's the situation: We all know that good documentation is crucial. When someone lands on your GitHub repo, they need to understand what the project does, how to get started, and what components are involved. But let's be honest â€“ writing comprehensive README files isn't exactly the most exciting part of our day, is it?

Instead of manually writing documentation (which I could definitely find better uses of my time for), I've developed a streamlined process using generative AI. Check out the video below where I go through my process for generating documentation.

## Notebook LM Audio Overview

![Robot Podcast](/images/newsletter/2024/11/11/2-robots-conducting-a-podcast.jpg)

Last week I published a [new issue](https://www.bytesizedai.dev/p/notebook-lm-audio-overview) on my other newsletter, ByteSized AI on [Notebook LM](https://notebooklm.google/). In that issue I talked about a particularly interesting feature called Audio Overview. NotebookAM's Audio Overview is a fascinating feature that transforms your written content into dynamic audio discussions. Instead of a monotonous text-to-speech conversion, it creates an engaging conversation between two AI hosts who discuss your content, make connections, and break down complex ideas into digestible segments.

I mention this because I have started taking my YouTube videos, blog posts and whatever other content I have and turning them into podcasts. The results were fascinating. Within minutes, NotebookLM generated a podcast-style discussion that not only summarized my main points but also added valuable context and connections I hadn't explicitly made in the original content.

I don't think I can stress that point enough. It is not just taking a blog post or a video and talking verbatim about the points made in its reference material. It is generating new content based on the document provided, and it does a perfect job of this. I have been throwing around the idea of turning this into an actual podcast, but I'm not there yet. For now, I have decided to create a [Notion site](https://danvega.notion.site/Developing-with-Dan-138550ad79c380ac935fdad17513b19c) where you can find all the episodes that I have generated.

## Rest Client OAuth2 Support

I talked about this in last week's episode but Spring Security 6.4 is adding Rest Client OAuth2 Support. This tutorial walks you through building a secure multi-module application from scratch, complete with authorization server, resource server, and client applications. In this step-by-step guide, we'll build a OAuth2 implementation using Spring Boot 3.4's latest features. Perfect for developers looking to implement secure authentication in their Spring applications!

## Query by Example

I received a question about using QueryByExampleExectuor in a GraphQL application. I thought it was a great question and plan on doing a video on it this week. Before we dive into that though I thought it was a good opportunity to take a look at what Query by Example is and when you might want to reach for it.

Tired of writing endless custom repository methods for your Spring Boot applications? In this tutorial, I'll show you how Query By Example (QBE) can revolutionize the way you handle dynamic database searches. Whether you're building a search form with multiple filters or need flexible querying capabilities, QBE is about to become your new best friend! ðŸš€

In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll build a complete Spring Boot application that demonstrates the power of Query By Example. I'll walk you through every step, from basic setup to advanced implementation, showing you how to eliminate boilerplate code and create clean, maintainable search functionality.
