Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of the newsletter. Last week was Halloween, and we had some amazing weather and the girls go so much candy for the parents to go through while they are sleeping ðŸ¤£

## New MacBook Announcement

The new [MacBook's were announced](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro) last week, and I was lucky enough to pick up a new one. I was able to order a new MacBook Pro M4 Max in space black, and I'm really excited to get my hands on this. I waited an entire day after the announcement though so mine won't be in for a couple of weeks. I did a quick [poll on Twitter](https://x.com/therealdanvega/status/1852174428773249264), and it seems like you're interested in a live stream where I set a new machine up so I will get that scheduled.

## In This Edition

In this edition of the newsletter I want to talk to you about Awesome Spring AI which is a new resource for Spring AI. I'm also really excited about the new OAuth2 support in the Rest Client, so I put together a repo on that and I will be recording a video on that this week. Finally, October was a great month on the YouTube channel where I added 13 new videos, 3 of which came last week and I will tell you about them.

## Awesome Spring AI

Last week on Spring Office Hours we sat down with the project lead for Spring AI, Dr Mark Pollack. It was great to catch up with him on where the project is and where it is heading.

We also had the opportunity to start a new resource for the Spring AI community called [Awesome Spring AI](https://github.com/danvega/awesome-spring-ai?). This is a curated list of awesome resources, tools, tutorials, and projects for building generative AI applications using Spring AI. This repository aims to help developers leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Spring ecosystem.

## RestClient OAuth2 Support

A new blog post dropped on the Spring IO Blog last week introducing support for OAuth2 in the Rest Client. If you follow me you know that I am a huge fan of the Rest Client and have done a number of tutorials on it in the past.

One of the most asked questions about it was how to use it in conjunction with OAuth2. There was a way to do this in the past, but it involved writing your own interceptor. The new support in Spring Security 6.4 (and Spring Boot 3.4) makes this really easy to do. I put together a [repository](https://github.com/danvega/golf-scheduler) showing this off and I plan to record a tutorial on it early this week.

## YouTube Videos (New)

I was able to record 3 new video last week and in case you missed them here they are. By the way if you aren't subscribed to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danvega) you should do so now so you don't miss my next one!

1. [**Spring Environment Variables**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQV76dufxz4): Never expose your API keys again! In this tutorial, we'll dive into managing environment variables in Spring Boot applications - the secure and professional way to handle configuration across different environments.

2. [**RestClient Logging**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l35P5GylXN8): Learn how to implement clean, efficient request/response logging for Spring Boot's REST Client! In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll build a reusable solution that gives you exactly the logging information you need, without the overwhelming verbosity of the underlying HTTP client logging.

3. [**Tokens are the currency of LLMs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUCVRppXPSc): Ever wondered how much your AI requests are actually costing you? In this comprehensive tutorial, we dive deep into understanding tokens - the currency of Large Language Models (LLMs) - and build a practical Spring Boot application to track and monitor your token usage.
