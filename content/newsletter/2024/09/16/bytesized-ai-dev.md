Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of the newsletter. I have had a lot going on this summer and that is why the issues have been a little infrequent. I have been writing a lot more lately and that is something that makes me happy. 

I mentioned this in a previous newsletter, but I'm writing a book with good my friend Nate Schutta titled ["Fundamentals of Software Engineering"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781098143220/). This has been a huge learning process for me but such a great experience. I finished my first chapter and as soon as it is in the early access edition I will be sure to let you know. 

Next week I will be in Dallas for [jConf](https://2024.jconf.dev/), and I am really looking forward to it. I will be giving an updated version of my talk "Building Intelligent Applications in Java with Spring AI". If you're going to be at jConf please say hi and let's talk about what you're doing with AI. In other news I had to pull out of dev2Next, and I'm super bummed out about this. I was really looking forward to this conference and have to withdrawal from conferences you were selected to speak at is never an easy decision. 

## ByteSized AI Newsletter 

As if I wasn't busy enough writing I decided to launch a new newsletter called [ByteSized AI](https://www.bytesizedai.dev/). I sent out an email about this last week but if you didn't catch it you can check it out [here](https://www.bytesizedai.dev/) and subscribe not to miss another issue. 

I started this newsletter because I really love learning about everything related to Artificial Intelligence and then writing about it. I also started it because I wanted a reason to check out the newsletter platform [Beehiv](https://www.beehiiv.com?via=Dan-Vega). I am absolutely loving everything about this platform. It has a truly enjoyable writing experience. I'm enjoying it so much that I plan on moving this newsletter over to it as soon as I can find the time to do it. 

In my next issue I will be talking about Open AI's two new models o1-preview and 01-mini. The o1 series introduces integrated chain-of-thought reasoning, a feature that promises to revolutionize how AI models approach complex problems and tasks.

## Java 23 

What a great time it is to be a Java Developer! We get a new version of the JDK every 6 months. JDK 23 will be released this week, and I'm really looking forward to it. I have a [blog post](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/jdk-23-first-look) highlighting some of the new features, enhancements and preview features.

You can join the Java 23 launch stream [here](https://dev.java/community/java-23-launch/). This is a 3.5-hour live stream covering the launch of Java 23 as well as community updates and what to expect from future releases. We will also have a special Spring Office Hours planned for Tuesday with special guest [Billy Korando](@BillyKorando) where we will talk all about it.

## YouTube

It's been awhile since I last posted a video on YouTube, but I'm hoping I can turn that around this week. I have a large number of ideas in the backlog and 3-4 videos that are ready to go. As I stated previously I have been pretty busy with other priorities but creating videos is what makes me the happiest. I crossed some pretty amazing milestones lately and I just want to say thank you for continuing to support the channel ‚ù§Ô∏è
