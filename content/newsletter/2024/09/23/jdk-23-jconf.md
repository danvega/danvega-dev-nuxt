Happy Monday and welcome to a brand-new edition of the newsletter! This is an exciting day for me because I've officially moved this newsletter over to [Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/?via=Dan-Vega). In last week's issue, I told you about a new newsletter I started called [ByteSized AI](https://www.bytesizedai.dev/), which is also powered by Beehiiv. I'm really enjoying everything about this platform and looking forward to continuing to write to you.

I originally started this newsletter as a way to keep myself consistently writing. These days, I don't have that problem with a blog, two newsletters, and my first book underway. Don't worry‚Äîthis newsletter isn't going anywhere‚Äîbut I'm curious what you'd like to hear about every week.

I kind of like just writing about what I'm up to. I have my hands in so many projects, and it's fun talking to all of you and letting you know what I'm doing. If you like this format, please let me know. If there are things you'd like to see in the newsletter, I'm open to suggestions.

One feature I might add is an "In the News" section where I highlight articles, videos, or tweets that I came across that week. I've done this in the past, but I think I have a better way to approach it now. I would love any feedback you have, with that lets get into it

**In todays email:**

- JDK 23 was released last week
- jConf in Dallas TX this week
- Tweets from the bird app
- Around the web
- Quote of the week

## WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK

### JDK 23

It's a great time to be a Java developer. If you have been around this ecosystem for a while you know how stagnant Java was for a long time. JDK 8 was released 3 years after JDK 7 and that waterfall approach took a long time. Now we get a new release every 6 months filled with new & preview features and enhancements.

Last week JDK 23 was released and there was a log of buzz around it. First off the team at Oracle had an awesome 3-hour release party where they went into great detail about everything included in this new version. If you haven't had a chance to catch the replay I suggested checking it out üëáÔ∏è

I put together a [blog post](http://www.danvega.dev/blog/jdk-23-first-look) to highlight some of these features if you want to check that out ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If you want to download JDK 23 you can get it from IntelliJ or by using [SDK Man](https://sdkman.io/).

### Spring Office Hours

Last week we had a special edition of the podcast on Tuesday where we sat down with Java Developer Advocate Billy Korando and talked about some of the new features in JDK 23. I love talking to Billy about all things Java because he is just so knowledgable and has really great insight and opinions on everything.

I had someone ask me on the live stream when Spring would support JDK 23. At the time I wasn't sure, but I thought it would be by the end of the week and sure enough it showed up on the Spring Initializr on Thursday last week. If you want to give JDK 23 a spin in a Spring Project you can do that right now!

If you want to read through all the JEPS included in this release you can do so [here](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/23/). This release was not just about the JEPs though as there were many notable issues resolved and deprecations and if you want to find out about those you can read through the [release notes](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/23all-relnotes.html).

## WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS WEEK

### jConf in Dallas TX

This week I will be heading to Dallas TX for [jConf](https://2024.jconf.dev/). It's going to be a really quick trip for me, but I'm excited for a bunch of reasons. I have the honor of presenting on Building Intelligent Applications with Spring AI. If you have been following me you know I'm very much into the AI space, and I'm a huge fan of how easy Spring AI makes it to build intelligent apps.

I'm also really excited for my favorite part of conferences and that is the hallway track. So many really great speakers are going to be there some of which I have never met before. I'm also really looking forward to catching up with some friends. If you're going to be there I will be there Tuesday afternoon and I leave Wednesday evening. I would love to catch up, meet or just say hello üëãüèª

Last week I had a chance to give the same presentation to the Houston Java User Group. I want to thank them for having me present. I thought it went really well, and we got some really great questions. One of which you can read about in the Tweets section below.

If you're interested in having me speak at your next user group meeting or conference please feel free to contact me. If you want to find out where I will be speaking next you can check out my [speaking page](https://www.danvega.dev/speaking).
