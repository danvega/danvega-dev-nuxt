Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of the newsletter. I know it's been a couple of weeks since you heard from me, but I promise I have some good reasons for that. I‚Äôm excited to announce that I have begun writing my first book!

This has been a significant career goal for me. I've always enjoyed writing, whether it's for this newsletter, my blog with over 1,000 posts, or documentation. It's something I've consistently enjoyed over the years. While this goal is not yet accomplished, I'm pleased to announce that I've started writing my first chapter.

I have had some offers to work on books over the years but the timing was never right. I have had little kids at home for the last 6 years and during those days of not sleeping I knew I couldn‚Äôt take on any extra work.

I also knew that I was going to hold to work on a book for a specific publisher. O‚ÄôReilly has long been the gold standard for tech books for me and you will find my bookshelf (Physical and Digital) lined with them. I knew that if I was going to write a book I wanted it to be with them. Lucky for me, I have been doing work with them on various projects over the years and the stars aligned with them on this one.

I have more to tell you about how this opportunity came up and who I‚Äôm co-authoring this book with (I‚Äôm really excited about that part) but that information will be coming soon. In the meantime I need to finish this newsletter and get back to writing the book. In this newsletter I want to talk about Spring AI 1.0.0 M1 and some things I have been working on around that release.

## Spring AI 1.0.0 M1

The first milestone release of Spring AI happened when I was in Barcelona for Spring I/O. I had a chance to see a lot of the new features being demonstrated at the conference and I was really excited to get back home and try them all out. If you haven‚Äôt had a chance to check out the blog post announcing 1.0.0 M1 you can check it out [here](https://spring.io/blog/2024/05/30/spring-ai-1-0-0-m1-released). If you look at the bottom of the announcement you will even see that I got a mention as a contributor to the project and that was AWESOME to see!

The first thing I did was go through [my repository](https://github.com/danvega/spring-into-ai) of examples that I use when I present on Spring AI and try to update them all based on the new features. I already thought that Spring AI was easy to use but the new fluent API for the chat client has made everything so much more concise and easy to read. Since the newsletter isn‚Äôt a great place to drop a bunch of code here is a screenshot that I think sums up the new API pretty well.

After I went through and got all of my demos updated I was ready to share the new features with some friends. A couple of weeks ago I presented on Building Intelligent Applications with Spring AI to my friends at the [San Francisco Java User Group](https://www.meetup.com/sfjava/events/299876110/). This meetup was recorded and when the recording becomes available I will share it with all of you.

Finally, we discussed the new release on last week‚Äôs episode of Spring Office Hours.

## üó£Ô∏è Speaking

Last week I gave a presentation virtually to the [JavaDay Lviv Conference](https://www.javaday.org.ua/program-2024-online). I really want to thank them for allowing me to share some of my favorite features in Spring Boot 3 and Beyond üöÄI‚Äôm not sure if these sessions were recorded, but I will look into that and if they were I will share them out.

This week I will be in Toronto giving a presentation on Spring AI and a Workshop on Spring AI which I am really looking forward to. Next week I will be at [KCDC](https://www.kcdc.info/) to both present on Spring Boot 3 and get some good BBQ with my friend DaShaun! As always if you want to find out where I will be next please check out my [speaking page](https://www.danvega.dev/speaking).

## üé• My Videos

I only have one video to share with you this week but I think it‚Äôs a good one. This is an introduction to using HTMX in Spring along with some fun demos. If you want to learn about how to add dynamic behavior to your web applications without having to write JavaScript this video is for you!
