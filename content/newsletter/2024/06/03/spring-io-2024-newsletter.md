Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of the newsletter. I just returned from Spring I/O 2024 and I feel rejuvenated in the only way a conference full of passionate Java and Spring developers can do. I work remote, and it isnâ€™t often I get to hang out with many of my coworkers. 

It was amazing to hear so many people come up to me during the conference and tell me how much my content is helping them on their journey. I heard from junior developers learning Spring for the first time, Senior developers brushing up on their skills and even a couple who were coming from another language & framework. 

It was a great reminder that what I am doing is making a real impact in the community and that I need to stay consistent with it and keep improving. If you want to read my recap of Spring I/O 2024 you can check out my blog post below.
