Hello and welcome to another edition of the newsletter. It's been a while since our last update, so there's a lot to catch up on. I decided to take a break in January, using it as a sort of "scream test." This is a term from software development where we shut down a service to see if anyone is still using it. If anyone reacts, it shows us who is still engaged with that service. I applied this principle here, and while no one responded, I'm perfectly fine with that. I plan to continue sending this newsletter but may introduce some changes. For now, let's dive into some of the exciting things that happened in January.

## Java Champion

Earlier this month, I was named a Java Champion, a career goal I've had for a long time. I'm incredibly grateful for this honor as it's a recognition from my peers, whose opinions I highly value. I've decided to write a [detailed blog post](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/java-champion) about my career and what this award means to me. I was eager to receive my polo and jacket, which I decided to wear to church this week. ü§©

## Rest Client

I'm a big fan of the new Rest Client in Spring Framework 6.1 and Spring Boot 3.2. I've mentioned it in presentations and on Twitter. I started receiving many questions that dove deeper into the subject matter, questions I didn't initially know the answers to. So, I decided to take a deep dive into the Rest Client.

I've spent some time learning about all the things you can do with the Rest Client and created a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/danvega/rest-client-examples) to share these examples. I've also made a few videos which you'll find in the section below. If there's anything else you'd like me to cover about the Rest Client or clients in general, please don't hesitate to reach out.

## Conferences & Events

### CodeMash

Earlier this month, I participated in CodeMash in Sandusky, OH, where I presented two talks. The first one was on 'Building GraphQL APIs in Java with Spring for GraphQL', which had a fantastic turnout and received amazing feedback.

The second talk was on 'Developer Advocacy', a topic I was presenting for the first time. I believe it went well, and I'm excited to present it again. If you're in the Cleveland area and interested in hearing this talk, please consider attending a [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/make-the-internet/events/298629881/) on Wednesday, February 7th.

### ConFoo

Next month I‚Äôm heading to Montreal Canada to attend and speak at my first ConFoo. I‚Äôm excited about this conference because it will be my first time there and there are so many amazing speakers in the lineup. I will be giving 2 talks, one on Spring for GraphQL and one on Spring Boot 3. If you plan on attending please stop by and say hello üëãüèª

If you‚Äôre ever interested in seeing what events or conferences I am speaking at you can check out the [speaking page](https://www.danvega.dev/speaking) on my website.
